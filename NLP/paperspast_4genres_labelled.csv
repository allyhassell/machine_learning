Your mother and 1 don't brag on our "" edgeucation,"" but aj common, low-browed parents, we aimed to be equaled by few and excelled by none. When I was young parents didn't go without clothes so that their children could get an ""edgeucation'' as they do nowadays. My folks was poor, thundering poor, you might say. It was some time before they could afford the luxury of a Webster's spelling-book for me, and then allow me to walk three miles in a tow shirt and a pair of linsey-woolsey pants to the hot-bed of learning. I hadn't been in the "" edgeucation"" business long before on accident happened to my library. The school-house wasn't rigged up with a furnace downstairs and them iron refrigerators in every room so that you can turn the warm off or on as you want to, but it was plain. It cost probably 47 dollars—including a wooden button on the outside door, which was supposed to hold the blamed thing shut when school was out at night. But one night in the early history of my junior year, as you would call it, the front door of the school-house got unbuttoned, and a half starved two-year-old steer wandered in there and spent the night. He swallowed my text-book while thinking over his past life, and so kind of shet off my currikulum, as you would say. I suppose I ought to have borrowed a copy of the Koran or the Illyad or some other big high-priced book, and laid down on my stummick and committed it to memory by the light of a pine knot, but at that time I hadn't read the rules for self-made men, or "" Every Man His Own Self-Made Man,"" so I didn't know what to do in order to get an "" edgeucation,"" or I would have got it or bust. I hate to have my children ashamed of me, so does your mother. That's all we care about. I don't care a cuss for an "" edgeucation"" for myself, but it grinds us to have you ashamed to show our letters to the other boys. That's why I want you to git so you kin write a good hand and use big words that it would take me a year to think of. Then your, children won't be ashamed of you when you come to be a father or a mother yourself, George. We'd like tip-top to come down this spring and see you, your mother and I, and listen to your valtudinarian, as you call it, and we could, too, only very likely we'd give the wholo blamtd thing away before we got through and make you so shamed you'd wish you was dead. So it's probably better for us to stay here and run the farm and keep you there as long as there's a shot left, for I want you to get your skin so full of knowledge that folks won't know what in Sam Hill you're talking about half the time. People here have kind of throwed it out from time to time that I lacked culture, and I admit that I have tried to use language on several occasions that I wasn't entirely familiar with, but that's neither here nor there. I want you to come home with words on you're tongue's end that will make the neighbor's heads ache. Some of 'em have allowed that I better have you come home and help support the family, but don't you worry about the family. You are there to get as much knowledge for the money as you can. I want you to be so that when you come home you can get the square root of a haystack In two minutes with your eyes shet, or talk to a Hebrew, or Mongo lian, or an agnostic in his own mother tongue, and so all-fired slick that he will think you was born right there yourself. Your mother is well barrin' a bone-felon on her thumb, which is not a very good thing for a woman of her age trying to ob her own work. She sends her earnest love to you, George, and she says she thinks of you night and day, and that no work is too tough that heirs to kind of lift her dear boy out of the low spear to which our poverty and bad spellin' has kind of sib* jected us to. As what's his name who run for president said, I guess you'd better burn this letter, George, and then your classmates can't U3e it again you. Enclosed you will find a postoffice money order for §2 38 to get the youker deck which you so much need. I don't know as I've spelled youker right, but you will be able no doubt to gather the idea.

But my object in visiting the place was not a'geuteelor a particularly polite one Queer customers was my quest, and a birdcag-:. maker the individual who had incited me to search for the sama at the public house in question His business premises are in Hare street, which is iu the immediate neighbor hood, aud our getting into conversation aro<e out of my calling there to nego tiate with him on behalf of a very young relative of mine for a iamily i]ians?on for white mica. The parlor of tho Pig and Pullet, though somewhat crooked, is capacious, and was at one time high in favor with the silk and vplvet weavers who hereabout are thickly colonised. It was something to be a weaver in those days. Spitalfields goods were at a premium and more in request than any other, and the men held the reins, and the mas>ers knuckled under. It was a grave offence against the work men's rules and regulations for a weaver to work on Mondays, and at holiday time—Whitsun or Easter—a master thought himself exceedingly lucky if his looms were kept idle no longer than three or four days in the week The Pig and Pullet was the meeting place for one of their couvivial club?, and on Saturday and Monday evenings the parlor was crowded with jolly fellows, each ""ood to spend his crown at the very least. There is a wof ul difference in these degenerate days; for a work in* weaver of that locality to spend a crown now would be to part with half a week's wages ; and if he ever locked in at the parlor of the Pig and Pullet on a Saturday night it would probably be to partake of a humble half-pint of fourpenny, which he would eke out to last him as long as he stayed. Now, as in the past, however, the tavern in question is a house of call for the ""fancy,"" especially for those whose hobby is singing birds. No doubt it is on that account that dew berry, the c;ige-maker, uses the Pullet as regularly as he does. There were a good many bird fanciers iu the parlor on tho evening I was there. You could not well mistake them. Each one brought in with him a cage con taining his heart's delight tied in a handkerchief, and this he hung on one of a range of mils placed there for the purpose, just over against the chair he Bit on. In some oases the bird cages were uncovered, in others they re mained muffled ; but apparently it made but little d fference to the feathered tenant. As soon as he was hung up and heard the others singing ho straightway joined in the already well-nigh deafening bird concert. •' But, speaking of queer customers,"" piesently remarked the talkative bird cage maker, ""the queerest that ever I came across is tho chap that is now just coming in at the door—Jarsper his name is—' Redbreast' we cM him"" The particularly "" queer customer "" nicknamed "" Redbreast,"" to whom my attention had been directed by the bird cage maker brought no cage in with him. Moreover, he was a sa-1 and un sociable looking individual, with short cropped hair, and with none of the bird like peikinesa that commonly distin guishes the "" fancier ""of low life Mr Glewbo ty and I were sitting at the end of the i oom where there were fewest people assembled, and the noise the birdtf hi tde was such that, speaking in a moderately Itw tone oE vt>ic?, there was not much danger of what we were talking about being overheard. i hazirded the conjecture that in what ever else tbe ""queerness"" of the in dividual alluded to might consist, he did not look the sort of person who could take delight in little finches. "" ITe is nob a fancier 1"" "" Well, Bpeaking in a general way,"" replud Mr Glewberry, ""he is not. You wouldn't rickon to call a man a fancier, anyway, who was sweet only on one bird, and that in a pccooliar sort of a way."" "" And what bird is that I'' "" The robin. That is the one he is nicknamed arter."" "" When you say that he is ' sweet' on that particular bird, you mean, I presume, that he admires it for its song before any other V The bird-cage maker smned to masticate my remark, together with the stem of his short clay pipe-, during several reflective moments, and then he Blowly made answer— "" Yes, no doubt that is the one view to take of it. But there are them who have known him longer than I have, and they think otherwise."" *' How otherwise V "" There aro grounds for their doing bo,"" continued Mr Glewberry, Bpeaking in a still lower tone, "" as, for instance, you'd nat'rally think that if a man liked a robin's song he would give that robin a chance of singing it "" "" No doubt that would be so."" •' But it isn't so. It is very well known and talked about th.it out of all the robins he's bought—and take all the year round, you might set the number down at least at six a week— he was never known to keep one for a matter of four-and-twenty hours, or to sell it again, or to do anything at all with it, if it comes to that."" "" But I don't understand—"" "" Being a total stranger, and never having clapped eyes on old Jarsper before iu your life, very likely not,"" Glewberry interrupted mo ; "" it *vould be a rum'un if you did. Nobody under stands it or can throw a light on it, not even the shoemaker, who lives in the front room, Jarsper occupying the back'un. He carn't throw alight on it"" "" Has the shoemaker to your know ledge been ques ioned on the subject 1"" "" * Did you ever hear a robin singing in Jarsper's room V I've asked him, and hia answer has br.en 'Never.' ' Did you ever see ono hanging up in his room?' I've further questioned him. 'l'll take my solemn oath,' aay3 he, 'that such a thing hain't happened onca in all the getting on for two yearß we have lodged in the same houf-e together.' Now what do you think of it?"" ""Only this,"" I replied, ""it must be a mistake as to Mr Jarsper's having a fancy for robins at all."" ""Then,"" asked Mr Glewherry, slap ping his leg, "" whut does ho buy 'r m fori"" ""You are sure, of course, that he does buy them 1 "" "" I've seen him buy dozens in this very room. He never misses, 'cept when he's hard up, and then, if one is offered to him he is the most miserable mau you ever see. He's that low spirited you c m't get a word out of him."" "" The bird-catchers who come here do a good trade with him 1"" "" They make a mark of him, sir There's never any call worth speaking of for robins. People are supen-ti tious about 'cm, and ihink they bring 'em bad luck, which so they do,"" said Mr Glowberry, thaking his head gravely; "" there's no mistake about that. I should reckon that there isn't one fancier in a half-dozen iu those parts, or in any other part, that couldn't tell you something about tho unluckiness of keeping caged robins— 'especially if they have been caught at mating time. Anyhow, the catchers are always glad to get rid of 'em at anything like a price, and Jarsper's price is sixpence. He isn't a man well up for money, but if it's the very last sixpence he's got that's how he'll lay it out if he's got the chance, He dou't want to borrow a cage to take a bird home in. He'll put it in a piper bag, and shove it in the bonom of his weskit as tender as though it was a babby, and that is the last anybody sees of it. Prom that minute it vanishes."" "" And how long has he been in the habit of making these strange pur chases 1"" "" Speaking 'cordin' to my own know ledge,"" replied the bird-cage miker, "" as long as I've knowed him, which is about two years. But I've been told 'hat he began it before that, when he lived out Hoxton way. I know a man who knows Jarsper well, and he te'ls me that he was took with what you may call his crankiness for redbreasts just at the time when first his wife and then their only young 'an died. If he'd been turned inside out he couldn't have become more altered than he was after that happened."" ""Altered for the better?"" A grim grin flitted over Mr Glew berry'a not particularly clean face as he niado answer : "" Well, 'cordin' as I've been given to understand, it would have took something uncommon power ful to have changed him for the wur, he being up till then just about as bad as they make 'em. ' Bully Jarsper,' they us""d to c*)l him,"" coutinued the bird-cage maker, speaking in a whisper, and glancing askance at the individual we were speaking of, and who was now placidly smoking his pips at the fur ther end of the room. "" He's a plas terer's) mould-maker, and could earn good money at one time of day, but he liked living on his wife's earniag-J rather than working, and was always drunk, and fighting, and in trouble with the police. I'm told he used to serve his wife cruel. She might have been alive now, veiy likely, if it hadn't bsen for him."" "" He didn't have a taste for robins at that time."" "" He was one of the sort, sir, who bragged that he didn't care for God, man, iior devil, a';d that will give you Li; measure. He robins now, though ; but wh.it he does with Vm after he's bought 'em is a corker."" "" PoiliMpa,"" 1 ventured, "" he has a taste for ihem in another w>y, and cooks and tats them."" The bird-cage maker laughed, "" i've heard some rummy sp-colla tions as to what hpcotuea of 'em, lu never one more unlikely than that of yours. Eat 'em ! Why, he's that tender in handling 'em you'd think he was afraid of brushing their feathers away. You ought to have seen a game I saw here atween him and a catcher over a rtdbreist, and you wouldn't suspect him of killing and eating 'em. He--J ar.;per I m<an —ain't long got over his illness through that affair. It wt-rry nigh settled him. He bruke a blood wessel."" "" HowT "" Well, it came about in this way. As I've already told you, having a robin, or p'r'aps two or three of 'em to sell, if a catcher knew where to find Jarsper, he'd wait on him. I've knowed him btfore now, when he's been with out a penny in his pocket, go out and pawn his silk neckhandkercher for a shilling rather than lose the offer cf a ouple. Wtli, the evening I'm speak ing of there wasn't many here, being Friday, when the money u scarce. Jarsper was here, though, and in comes a bird catcher, more than half drunk, with a robiu in a cige, and he ofl'ers it to Jarsper at the old price. But it happened that Jarsper had no money at all—fact, just before the man came in he had stuck up the price of a piut, promising to pay it next d»y."" "" But you were all friends here. Could not ho borrow that small sum of one of youl"" ""He trhd to borrow sixpence, but there wasn't one that was able to do it. So he says to the ca'cher: 'lt isn't the first time we've had a deal together. Let me hj ive the bird, and I'll pay you next time I see you.' But the other was a rough 'un, and he swore at Jumper for being a cause of disappoint ment to h'm. 'l've come half a-rnile to bring it,' he ' and if you want it you'll have to pay for it on the nail.' 1 1 don't want it without the money,' says Jarsper. l Keep it for us till to-morrow, and I'll buy and pay for it' But the catcher wouldn't hear of that I've brought it here to get rid of it, and t don't meant to take it away ag-xin,' he says. 'lf you won't buy it 1 shall wring its neck, which would be a pity,' he fays, ' for it's one of the prettiest 1 ever s<e.' "" Hearing this, Jarsper he pricked up his ears and came in a hurry across the room to look at it, and as he did so the redbreast began to flutter in itd cage just as though it knowed him, and to chirp up at him as though it understood what the chap had been saying about, ita neck being wrung if didn't buy it, and was asking him to pre went it. Leastways it rau t have been in some such light that Jarsper took it, for he says to the catcher, in a frightened sort of voice : 'Taint likely you mean it when you talk about kill ing it. You wouldn't be such a fool. Save it till the morning and I'll give you ninepence for it; or, look here,' ho says, taking out his pocket knife, which was a good 'un, 'tike this, and I'll give you ninepence back for it any time.' "" But the other wouldn't listen to anything but payment in ready money. As I've told you, he was hj ilf drunk, and one of the bullying sort, and he says : ' Are you going to have it and pay for it now, or am I to wring its neck and chuck it in the fireT It was rum to see the change that came into Jarsper's face then. It was just as though the mention of fire had burnt him, same us red-hot iron would. He made a snatch at the cage, but the other was too quick for him, and in his drunken passion he gives tho little cage one smashing blow wiih his greit fist, of course killing the redbreast in side, and then he catches it up and make? for the fireplace with it to do what he said he would. "" I believed then, and I believe now, that it was a narrow squeak of Jarsper murdering him. Ho still had in his hand the knife what he'd offered to pait with, and the big blade was open, and before the catcher could get to the fueplace, with it tight gripped in his Hit, and with such a cry as I never heard come out of a man's mouth, he makes a spring after him. But he hadn't got half across the room before down he sprawled headlong on to the floor; and them that helped him up found that he was bleeding from the mouth a precious sight more than if he hud only knocked himself in filling, And it was found that it was a wesfel he hj id brokn, and he was laid up with it for over two months. He hasn't got his strength back yet, aud some my he nev,',r will. He's 'bliged to walk with a stick anyhow, and some times he comes over so weak that he's glad if somebody will help him home.""

Ward concerning the proposal to adopt electricity for the haulage of the tramway cars instead of horse-power, it seems to me a monstrous thing that the Government should be allowed to stand in the way of this,scientific improvement—not only for the public's benefit, but also in preventing cruelty to horses in dragging the cars up Princes street. As our mayor justly says, a very strong feeling exists in the minds of our citizens that nothing should be allowed to stand in the way of this much - needed and urgent reform. The streets belong to the the public, as ratepayers, and I contend they have the right to do as they may think proper with the said streets. They as a body consider that electricity for the haulage of our cars is far better, not only doing away with cruelty to horses, but also as a benefit to shopkeepers, in that it will create less dust. As to the telephone system, we all know it is thoroughly defective, and, putting aside the Tramway Company, it is the duty of the Government to immediately make it a perfect telephone system for its subscribers as a body, and see that it is in no way inter fered with by other electric currents. As regards the use of electricity for tram haulage, or electricity for lighting our City, the public pay for the fixing up of their streets, and I contend it is. nothing to do with the Government; and if they decide to have electricity for the haulage of the cars the Government have no right to stand in the way of such a needed reform in every sense of the word. It answers admirably in Hobart, therefore why not in Dunedin? As to the electrical experts, in any case it is for our Government ,t° immediately put the telephones right. I sec the Tramway Company's meeting is to be held on Wednesday • next, and I trust the matter, between now and then, Mill be settled in favor of the company by the Government consenting to grant ah Order in-Couucil allowing the use of electricity. I, with many others, consider that the Government have all along treated the com pany disgracefully. The idea of asking the company to make right this very defective telephone system ! They might just as well ask me or anyone else to be at the expense of doing it. I aril glad to see the company have decided not to contribute a fraction towards making the telephone system a per fect one. All the company and the public require of the Government is justice.—l am, etc., .Reformation. Duiiediiii January 27;",LetterToEditor

This astounding discovery, thus made, was dreadful to me. It was true then. Eleanore the; beautiful, the love some, was — I did not, could not finish the sentence;, even in the silence of my own mind. ' You look surprised,' said Mr Gryce, glancing curiously towards the key. ' Now I ain't. A woman does not thrill ancl blush and equivocate and faint for nothing ; especially such a wo man as Miss Leavenworth.' ' A woman who could clo such a deed would be the last to thrill, equivocate, and faint,' retorted I. ' Give me the key ; let me see it.' He complacently put it in my hand. ' It is the one we want,' said he. ' No getting out of that.' I returned. 'If she declares she is innocent, 1 will bedieve her.' He stared with great amazement. 'You have strong faith in women,' laughed he. ' I hope you will live to find them worthy of it.' I had no reply for this, ancl a short silence ensued, first broken by Mr Gryce. ' There is but ono thing left to clo,' said he. ' Fobbs, you will have to request Miss Leavenworth to come clown. Do not alarm her, only see that she comes. To the reception room,' added he as the man drew off. No sooner were we left alone than I made a move to return to Mary, but he stopped me. ' Gome ancl see it out,' whispered he. ' She will be down in a moment ; see it out, you hacl best.' Glancing back, I hesitated ; but the prospect of beholding Eleanore again, drew me in spite of myself. Telling him to wait, I returned to Mary's side to make my excuses. ' What is the matter — what has occurred V said she breathlessly. ' Nothing as yet to disturb you much. Do not be alarmed.' But my faco be trayed mo. ' There is something,' said she. ' Your cousin is coming down.' ' Down here ? and she shrank visibly. ' No, to the reception-room.' «I do not understand. It is all dreadful, and no one tells me anything.' ' Miss Leavenworth,' I essayed, ' I pray God there may be nothing to tell. Judging from your present faith in your cousin, there will not be. Take comfort, then, and believe that I will inform you if anything occurs which you ought to know.' Giving her a look of reassurance, I left herVrushed against tho crimson pillows of the sofa on which she sat, and rejoined .Mr Gryce. We had I scarcely entered the reception-room, when Eleanore Leavenworth cam 3 in. More languid than she was an hour before, but haughty still, she slowly advanced, and meeting my eye, gently bent her head. ' I have been summoned hero,' said she, directing herself exclusively to Mr Gryce, ' by an individual whom I take to be in your employ. If so, may I request that you will make your wishes known at once, as 1 am quite exhausted and am in great need of rest.' ' Miss Leavenworth,' returned Mr Gryce rubbing his hands together and staring in quite a fatherly manner at tho door-knob, ' I am very sorry to trouble you, but the fact is I wish to ask you — ' But here she stopped him. 'Any thing in regard to the key which tliat man lias doubtless told you, he sxw me drop into the ushes V 'Yes, Miss.' ' Then I must refuse to answer any questions concerning it. I liave nothing to say on the subject, unless it is this ;' — giving him a look full of suffering but full of a certain sort of courage too — ' that he was right if he told you I had the key in hiding about my person, and that I attempted to conceal it in the ashes of the grate.' ' Still, Miss—' But she had already withdrawn to the door. ' I pray you to excuse mo,' said she. 'No argument you could advance would make any difference in my determination, therefore it would be but a waste of energy on your part to attempt any.' Ancl with a Hitting glance in my direction, tliat was not without its appeal, she quietly left the room. For a moment Mr Gryce stood gaz ing after her with a look of great interest, then bowing almost to the ground in his homage, he hastily fol lowed her out. I had scarcely recovered from the surprise occasioned by this unexpected movement, when a quick step was hoard in the hall, and Mary, flushed and anxious, appeared at my side. ' What is it V said she. ' What has Eleanore been saying V ' Alas !' I answered, ' she has not said anything. That is the trouble, Miss Leavenworth. Your cousin pre serves a reticence upon certain points that is very painful to witness. She ought to understand that if she persists in doing this, that — ' ' That what f Thero. was no mis taking the fearful anxiety that prompted this question. ' That, she cannot avoid the trouble that will ensue.' For a moment sho stood gazing at me with great horror-stricken, incredu lous eyes ; then sinking back into a chair, flung her hands over her face with the cry : ' Oh, why were we ever born ! Why were we allowed to live ! Why did we not perish with those who gave us birth!' Iv the face of anguish like this, I could not keep still. 'Dear Miss Leavenworth,' J essayed, ' there is no cause for such despair as this. The future looks dark, but not impenetrable. Your cousin will listen to reason, ancl in explaining — ' But she, deaf to my words, had again risen to her feet ancl stood before me in an attitude almost appalling. ' Some women in my position would go mad !' she whispered, ' mad, mad !' 1 looked at her with growing wonder. I thought I knew what she meant. She conceived that she had given us the cue, which had led to this suspicion of her cousin, and that in this way the trouble which hung over their heads was of her own niaking. I endeavored to soothe her, but my efforts were all unavailing. Absorbed in her own anguish, she paid but little attention to me. Satisfied at last that I could clo nothing moro for her, I turned to go ; the movement seemed to arouse her. ' I am sorry to leave,' said I, ' with out having afforded you any comfort. Believe me that I am very anxious to assist you. Is there no one I can send to your side ; no woman friend or rela tive 1 ? It is sad to leave you alone in this house at such a time.' 'And do you suppose,' said she, ' that I intend remaining here 1 Why, I should die. Here to-night V and the long shudders shook her very frame. ' It is not at all necessary,' broke in a bland voice over our shoulders, 'that you should do so, Miss Leavenworth.' I turned with a start. Mr Gryce was not only at our back, but had evi dently been there for some moments. Seated in an easy chair near the door, one hand in his pocket, the other caress ing the arm of his chair, he met our gaze with a sidelong smile that seemed at once to beg pardon for the intrusion, and to assure us that it was made with no unworthy motive. 'Everything will be properly looked after, Miss; you can leave with perfect safety.' I expected to see her resent this interference, bnt instead of that she manifested a certain satisfaction in .be holding him there. Drawing me to one side she whis pered, 'You think this Mr Gryce very clever, do you not V 'Well,' replied I cautiously, 'he ought to be to hold the position he does. The authorities evidently repose great confidence in him.' Stepping from my side as stu7.de.nly as she had approached it, she crossed i the room and stood lvfev'.* Mr Gryoo, ' Sir,' said she, gazing at hini with a glance of rui treaty. ' 1 hear that you have great talents ; that you can ferret out the; real criminal from a score, of doubtful characters, aud tliat, nothing can escape tho penetration of your eye. If this is so, have pity on two orphan girls suddenly bereft of their guardian and protector, ancl use your acknow ledged skill in finding out who has committed this crime. It would be folly in me to endeavor to hide from you that my cousin in her testimony has given cause for suspicion ; but I here declare that I believe her to be as innocent of wrong as I am myself, and 1 am ouly endeavoring to turn the eye of justice from the guiltless to the guilty, when I entreat you to look elsewhere for the culprit who committed this de el.' Pausing, she held her two hands 0-it before him. 'It must have been some common burglar or de sperado ; can you not bring him, then, to justice 1 ?' Her attitude was so touching, her whole appearance so earnest and ap pealing, that I saw Mr Gryco's counten ance brim with suppressed emotion, though his eye never left tlie coffee-urn upon which it had fixed itself at her first approach. ' You must find out — you can,' she went on — ■ Hannah, the girl who is gone, must know all about it. Search for her, then, ransack the world, clo anything ; my property is at your dis posal. I will offer a largo reward for tlie detection of the burglar who did this deed.' Mr Gryce slowly rose. 'Miss Leavenworth,' said he, and then stopped ; the man was actually agitated. ' Miss Leavenworth, I did not need your very touching appeal to incite me to my utmost duty in this case. Per sonal and professional pride were in themselves sufficient. But since you have honored mo with this expression of your wishes, I will not conceal from you that 1 shall feel a certain increased interest in the affair from this hour. What mortal man can, I will do, ancl if in one month from this day T clo not come to you for my reward, Ebenezer Gryce is not the individual ""I have always taken him to be.' ' Ancl Eleanore ? 'Wo will mention no names,' said he, gently waving his hand to and fro. A few minutes later I left the houso with Miss Leavenworth, she having testified her wish that I would accom pany her to the home of hor friend Mrs Gilbert, with whom she had de cided to take refuge. As we rolled away in tho carriage Mv Gryce; had bceui kind enough to provide for us, I noticed my companion cast a look of regret behind her, as if she could not help feeding some compunction at this desertion of hor cousin. But this ex pression soon changed for the alert look of one who dreads to see a certain face start up from some unknown quarter. Glancing up and down the street, peer ing furtively into doorways as we passed, starting ancl trembling if a sudden figure; appeared on the curb stone, she did not seem to breathe with perfect ease till we had left the avenue, behind us and entered upon Thirty seventh street. Then all at once hor natural color returned, ancl leaning gently towards me she askeei if I hael a pencil and piece of paper 1 could give her. I fortunately possessed both. Handing them to her, I watched her with some little curiosity, while she; wrote two or three linos, wondering she should choose such a time ancl place for the purpose. 'A little note I wish to send,' she remarked, glancing at the almost illegible scrawl with an expression of doubt. ' Couldn't you stop the carriage a moment while I direct it V I did so, ancl in another instant the leaf which I had torn from my note* book was folded, directed, and sealed with a stamp which she hacl taken from her own pocket-book. ' That is a crazy looking epistle,' she murmured, as she laid it, direction downwards, in her lap. ' Why not wait, then,' I suggested, ' till you arrivo at your destination, where you can seal it properly, and . direct ib at your leisure V ' Because lam in haste. I wish to mail it now. Look, there is a box ou the corner; please ask the driver to stop once more.' ' Shall I not post it for you V 1 asked, holding out my hand. But she shook her head, and with out waiting for my assistance, opened the door on her own side of the carriage and leaped to the ground. Even then she paused to glance up ancl down the street, before venturing to drop it into the box. But when it was done sho looked brighter and more hopeful than I had yet seeniher. Ancl when in a few moments later she turned to. bid mc good-bye in front of her friend's house, it was with almost a cheerful air sho put out her hand and entreated mo to call on her the next day and inform her how the inquest progressed. I shall not attempt to disguise from you the fact that I spent all that long evening in going over tho testimony given at the inquest, endeavouring to ""reconcile what I had heard with any other than that of Eleanore's guilt. Taking a piece of paper, I jotted clown the leading causes of suspicion as fol lows : — 1. Hor late disagreement with her un clo, and evident enstrangement from him, ua f ratified to by Mr Harwell. i 2. The mysterious disappearance of one of the servants of the house. 3. The forcible accusation of her cousin — overheard, howevar, only by Mr Gryce and myself. ■I. Hay ci] invocation in regard to that handkerchief of hers, found stained with pistol smut on the scene of tho tragedy. 5. Her refusal to speak in regard to the paper which she was supposed to havo taken from Mr Leavenworth's tablo, immediately upon the removal of the body. G. Tho finding of the library key in her possession. ' A dark record,' I involuntarily cried as I looked it over, but even in doing so began jotting down on the other side of tho sheet the following explanatory notes : 1. Disagreements and even estrange ments between relatives are common. Cases where such disagreements and estrangements have led to crime, rare. 2. The disappearance of Hannah pointed no more in one direction than another. 3. If Mary's private accusation of her cousin was forcible and convincing, her public declaration that she neither knew nor suspected who might be the author of this crime, was equally so. To be sure the former possessed the advantage of being uttered spontane ously, but it was likewise true that it was spoken under momentary excite ment, without foresight of the conse quences, and possibly without due consideration of the facts, 4. 5. An innocent man or woman, under the influence of terror, will often equivocate in regard to matters that seem to criminate them. G. But the key ! What could I say to that 1 Nothing. With that key in her possession and unexplained, Elea nore Leavenworth stood in an attitude of suspicion, which even I, who was so adverse; to believing her guilty, was forced to recognise. Brought to this point, I thrust the paper into my pocket ancl took up the evening Ex press. Instantly my eye fell upon these words :",Fiction

It was reported to be, and rumor lied not, the meanest bank in the colonies. It paid starvation wages, and if a clerk robbed the corporation he was pursued to Pentridge Gaol with a hatred that never held its hand. Other banks saved the credit and souls of the unhappy erring ones by a compromise, taking their relatives' money, and bidding them go and sin no more. But the Bovine Bank never relented. Granite could not be harder than the heart of the manager, Mr. William Whin stun, who had been elected by Mr. Gifford. Those who indulged in jokes at the expense of the Bank said when the appointment -was about to be made Mr. Gifford was greatly exercised as to the merits of Whinstun and an opponent, each equally penurious and graspiDg, but waa decided by the manner in which the former beat down an orangewoman a penny while his rival paid the technical price. Women, young and beautiful, sisters, mothers, wives with babies at the breast ; men, grey-headed fathers tottering on the verge of the grave, had knelt before this man and offered double the sum the loved one had stolen in vain. He took the money, and sent the lad to Pentridge to become a curse to mankind. "" The law of God,"" said this cruel man, ""forbade to show mercy in such oases,"" forgetting that the name of God is Mercy. At his hand, when he would face the Dread Tribunal, would be required many a lost im mortal soul, for he had caused the crime and then punished it too severely. When Herbert's father died he wa3 elected not only director of the Bovine Bank, but also chairman, a safe proceeding enough, for the directors felt certain he coald not do any thing. They were all nominees of the dead Gifford, men with their hearts of iron and faces of flint. Herbert had indeed succeeded, young as he was, to all his father's offices, but on muoh the same standing. He already hated, as much as he oould hate, the manager of his Bank, and had resolved upon his re moval. He had dreaded, detested, the man since ho remembered, for Whinstun was a frequent visitor at his home. Herbert re membered, too, many a case of desolate de spairing women, kneeling at his mother's feet, clinging to her garments, and begging, through their sobs and tears, for her inter cession for a loved one with her huaband. And ho recollects, too well, the terrible agony of that gentle creature, who could do nothing. Her husband never allowed her to say a word about business. She would tell her son that a great day of retribution would come, if not in thia world in that in which God alone is judge, and now that oon had risen in judg ment. And Herbert remembered how many an honest man this wretch had ruined by coming down upon him at an inopportune moment, merely that himself and his fellows might obtain the property at a third the value. He recollected, one day, being in the bank and hearing the voice of a man, broken with sob 3, imploring for time, and the harsh reply, ""It cannot be done; the directors are inflexible,"" and he knew now that man's god — that man who, if allowed six months' grace, could now be the richest man in Australia— had lifted to fortune the harpies of the Bo vine Bank, Whinstun amongst them. The victim had died of drink, a vagrant, on the streets. And more than that, Whinstun's son had destroyed the poor man's daughter. Herbert could well remember how he first saw those two together ; in Survey Park, on the banks of the Yarra, and how he saw the ! victim last. Young Whinstun, who was on j the river in an outrigger, paused while he i looked at Lucy Morton ; her jovial father mopping his head in the distance. And now Herbert resolved to strike a terrible blow at this man. He thought that the lost souls and the ruined men and women that strewed hi 3 path called upon him to avenge them, that it was a sacred cause. He felt his mighty power for the first time, and resolved to use it in crushing Whinstun, who was known to have been his father's evil counsillor. And the last scene; Oh, who describe it ; both scenes had burnt themselves into Herbert's memory. He had heard that this same Whinstun had been with Morden and his father in the early times, and that it was Whinstun who had helped to work Morden out of his property. The very day after he had increased the salaries, he drove into the city to attend the meeting of the direotors. As he passed through Collins-street groups stopped and gazed at him, oven more so than usual. The news had leaked out, and the monetary classes were furious. Wages would have to be raised all round now; men on stations adjoining Gilford's would not stop at the old rate. When he got to the banking chamber he was greeted by the grey-haired directors with a chorus of horror. ""Mad,"" ""foolish,"" and such epithets were showered at him. He simply took his seat at the head of the table with the curt observation, "" I will do what I please in my own affairs,"" silenoing these men at once, for this was a maxim they greatly affected, especially in politics. Business proceeded smoothly enougn until the close. ""That is all the business on the paper to-day,"" said Herbert, as he saw preparations for departure being made ; "" are there any notices to give ? "" Herbert had thoroughly restrained him self during the meeting, not even interfering when bills or accommodation were denied to worthy men, simply because the money avail able was wan tad for the friends of the direc torate. Whinstun was usually a sort of despot, even with the directors ; but since Herbert had sat in the chair he had been suavity itself, and to-day he was most defer ential towards the chairman. Ho looked upon him as a plastic twig, to be bent to his own purposes after proper training ; ignorant of the intricacies of bantering, what could he do but follow the guidance of an acknow ledged expert. Whinstun had no knowledge of the severe training to whioh Herbert had subjected himself for long dreary months, and the great business capacity of the young man, inherited from his father ; hitherto latent because it had not been called forth, because life had been too pleasant. Mr. Whinstun was to be terribly undeceived. Ho was a great reader of faces, and h&d the ocoasion arose and he had studied Herbert's face that day, he might have seen in it a set purpose to do something that was perilous, and required strength and nerve. While some discussion had been proceeding conversationally as to certain clients' finan cial position, Herbert had carefully written out two small slips of paper — each the same size— one of which he tore up. When there was no response to his query about notices, the directorate carried on business in a semi parliamentary style. He rose— not to go, that was evident, but to speak— and his appearance at once arrested those who were about to rise, and glued them to their chairs. ""What now?"" thought the directors and manager; another of his freaks. What do we care ? he can't carry them here ; the laws we work under will not allow that, we have the power."" Herbert hesitated for a moment, and his face flashed; ha felt the great contest to which he was committing himself. He looked at each face familiar to him, disliked by him since childhood, and he saw on each a grim look that said plainly enough, ""We defy you ; we have the power here."" This in reality nerved him to the fright, braced him to begin that great struggle, fraught with, momentous consequences. In a moment he had grasped all his plans and pronounced them perfect. "" Gentlemen,"" he said, at first thickly, and with stops caused by the beating of bis heart, but soon cold, clear, and distmct ; "" I give notioe that at the next meeting I will move that & special meeting of the proprietors in the Bovine Bank be called, as provided for : —First, for the purpose of raising the salaries of the employ6s 25 per cent. ; and, second, tor the dismissal of the present manager, Mr. William Whinstun. The meeting is now ad journed."" He moved from bis chair to take his hat '■ and cane, bat not a soul save him as much as twitched a muscle, except those governing the eyes and mouth. It seemed as if a ! thunderbolt had struck them. The blood , receded from the manager's pale face until it j grew a ghastly green. He was t\e first to recover, however, and to spring to his feet, ] the blood r ashing to his face as it had not i for many a year, and crimsoning it. The other direotors could but shut their eyes and mouths, and put their hands to their ears as | if disbelieving these organs. 11 This motion,"" cried Mr. Whinstan, loud enough to be heard (the sound, not the words) in the banking chamber, at which the olerks and customers were horror-stricken, for no such sound had ever been heard to proceed from the directors' room, "" is bunkum', sheer bunkum. You know you cannot carry it, proud and rich as you are. Withdraw it at once, unless you want to destroy the pro perty, to run the bank's shares down from £25 to os. The public will lose faith in us if we allow them to know wo have a fool and a madman as chairman."" The directors, slow-witted men, but of the surest kind, had been unable to grasp the situa tion until their manager spoke. Then, at a moment, tho helplessness of Herbert through the voting powers conferred by the bank's laws burst upon them as a gleam of sunshine on a heretofore darkened landscape, and the reaction being very great, they broke into what the walJs of that chamber had never heard, a roar of laughter. The clerks and customers heard it, and staggered with amazement. What wa3 the Bovine Bank coming to ? One fat director, in his exhilaration, abso lutely rose and snapped hia finger in Her bert's face. Whinstun stood bold and de fiant. At first, when Herbert had read the notice, he thought the trumpet of doom had sounded ; the catastrophe that would follow, which would utterly destroy him aa he had destroyed so many better men, flashed acrosß his brftin, and nearly stopped his heart. Now, he had grasped his position, which he thought impregnable, and felt confident ; not only so, but revengeful. ""If the meeting wasn't closed, and we oould re-open it,"" said the fat man, who had been for years sustained by the bank, "" I think I'd move for an extraordinary meeting to re move the Chairman."" "" Next meeting yoa can do this, Mr. Ox ham,"" said the manager, with a diabolical smile. "" I have nothing more to say,"" said Herbert. "" I have given notice in a proper manner, and when the time comes it will be seen which of U 3 will prove the stronger. Don't spare me ; I don't intend to spare you."" The latter sentence was directed to the manager, upon whom it had a visible effect, for again doubts sprang up in hia mind. He knew Herbert's power was very great. But he also knew that the directors and the principal shareholders were tied to him by adamantine chains, and his face brightened, and he al most looked smiling, if that could be said oi his saturnine face, as Herbert with a defiant air walked out, his youth, beauty and grace forming a strange contrast to the bloated or withered harpies in the director's room. "" Dismiss thi3 matter for a moment,"" said the manager as Herbert disappeared ; I have important instructions to give."" And he went into his own room, which was just behind the banking chamber.

One wild, sad night — it was past 12 o'clock, and all the household had gone to bed— Leonore mounted the narrow stairs alone, passing one by one the dark untenanted rooms in the tower, till she came to the topmost chamber, which she entered, stationing herself by tho dusty window at the end. The wind was ris ing, hurrying the clouds across a watery moon. Above the gables rose, straight and black against the sky, the flagstaff, with its pennon coiled about it. Yot some time, in spite of the increasing ■winds, it seemed to cling the closer as they strove to tear it off, when suddenly across the downs came up a strong gust from the sea, and lo ! the great flag, with a leap towards the heavens, unfurled itself, and streamed out grandly in the gale, and the girl's heart gave a bound of triumph, for it seemed to her a favour ing omen. Then the wind blew strong and steady, wrestling with the' flag, setting the flag staff rocking, and the trees that clothed the hill sides surging like storm-tossed waters. Sometimes, as the wind eddied, the flag would suddenly fail, and flop against the pole, and then as suddenly unturl again ; for a fresh blast had come up from the south, where out upon the waves the ships were wildly tossing, many to be wrecks before the morrow. Xieonore knelt at her window, watching the wild clouds flying before the passion of the ■•storm, while the wind roared and Rhrieked and blustered round the tower. The flag was streaming still, but torn and battered into shreds, as though it had been through a dozen fierce campaigns, and yet it held on bravely. It was a valiant struggle ! Leonore watched it breathlessly. At lust with a savage yell, the wind came crashing down upon the tower, and, snapping off the flagstaff like a twig, swept it bodily, flag and all, as if the whole thing were a floating feather on tha storm-tide, away into tho night ! And this, too, Leonore accepted as an omen. — "" Whom Nature Leadeth "": by G. Noel Hat ton. A POOB GOVERNESS. A few pictures affected me deeply, and have engraved themselves on my heart's memory. One by Redgrave, "" The Poor Teacher ""—Go verness it should have been called. At the side of a long school-desk sits a slim, pale, elegant girl, such as I have often seen, clad in black, her hair flowing simply over her cheeks, a tear in her down-cast eyes as she gazes on the floor. Her thoughts are on home, for on her knee she unconsciously holds open a letter, beginning ""My dear child."" Her small hands and feet, and the delicacy of her complexion, mark her birth, and her mourning dress shows her to have been the victim of- some domestic, misfortune. On the desk lie books, and the usual paraphernalia of school ; beside her is a tray, with a small teacup, and a thin slice of bread and butter untasted ; her meals sent to her from the breakfast- room, mark her degra dation in the sight of those who are unworthy to kiss the ground on which she treads. At her feet lies a basket of work. This picture, as a whole, telling so common but so melancholy a tale, is deeply moving, and one turns away from it with a feeling of sadness, which shrinks, as from an insult, from the flaunty colours of some neighbouring pictures of a widely differ ent subject. Oh ! did the rich but understand how the pupils pay the penalty of the teacher's depression, their eyes would be opened to tho bvilb they so ignorantly and_ heartlessly suffer, if not create. . A broken-spirited instructor — what is to be hoped for the pupil ?— "" The life of Dr Hargan."" AN UNWELCOME VISITOR. He doesn't take off his hat until he ha 3 shut the door behind him ; there is nothing in his entrance of that graceful gliding in, and simul taneously shutting the door, combined with the removal of tho hat, which, if you can manage it without getting your stick caught in the handle and dropping it, is so effective, and serves so well to impress the person on whom you have intruded in your favour— oh no !he comes in and then turns his back full on you to Bhut the door, and then, as if by an after thought, he recollects that he has got his hat on, and removes it. Then he says, "" Mr So-and-so, I think,"" in a way which makes one wish that one was any body else for the moment, and at the same time he moves towards your best arm-chair. I say "" Yes,"" and rise from my writing-table, and also move towards the same chair. ""Oh,. l'm What's-his-name— ,"" hero he has gained upon you a little — "" and my aunt knows your aunt, and she told me— "" here I see that, even if I do hurry myself, the least I can effect will be that we shall arrive at the chair in a dead heat, and I reflect that it won't look well if. we have to struggle for its possession, so I give up, resolving however, not to let the next freshman do me in this way— ""to come and see you."" Here he flops himself down in the chair, and looks me all over with an eye of satisfac tion. ""Oh yes,"" I reply, smothering my indigna tion at his forwardness under the cloak of welcome as far as possible, "" I've been to see you—"" here he crosses his legs in a nonchalant sort of a way that annoys me, and makes me long to say, "" TJucross your leg,"" but I don't — "" I suppose you saw my card ?"" No, ho hasn't noticed my card — 'pon my word the fellow's insolence is becoming past bearing ; he suppose ""it has got shoved away somewhere by his landlady amongst the others "" — My card, if you please,"" shovud amongst the others ;"" but he has written out a list of people , he knows he's got to call upon sooner or later, ' and he's b'oeu taking them in order, and has just got to me this afternoon ; don't I think it's rather a good dodge ? "" Don't I what ?""— lam fuming by this time. ""Oh yes, yes ; it is an awfully good dodge,"" and I laugh hys terically. Hullo ! there's his hat and stick lying across my table, the muddy point of his stick in close proximity with one of my priza books. I move it hastily j he does not jump up, as he oughtj apologise, and try to drag it out of my hands, in order to save me the trouble of putting it somewhere else, but aimply remains where he is, and looks at me. Then I sit down in the hard chair, and try to recover myself sufficiently to think of something to say. He saves me the trouble, however by starting the question of boating. ""Do I row ?"" I pay, "" Not much ; I suppose you've been tubbing ; freshmen always get caught their first term ?"" He is long past tubbing ; lor, yes, why he's been rowing in one of his College Trial Eights for the last fortnight. Then it comes out that he is a great oar, stroke of the eight at his public school arid all that. I change the sub 1 ject- to bicycling. No, he doesn't bicycle, but he does worse— he thinks bicycling is the sort of thing only "" smugs "" do. 1 bicycle ; I don't tell him so, however, but go on to some thing else. And so on, I feeling as if 1 were growing smaller and smaller, and he bigger and bigger, till, as a last resource, I ask him when he can come to lunch. ""lain very son y,"" but I look at my watch and find I must go out. "" You see, being a reading man, I have to be rather jealous of my time."" We settle a day for lunch, and leave the room, he rising slowly, and coming out after me ; yes, he has actually driven me out of my own room. Then we part, and I think that I have let myself in for another jolly hour or so with him.—"" A Cam bridge Staircase.""",Fiction

I do not for a moment suppose that hie tif'»tincrit of the subject is objectionable, as both he and j'our contemporary have all aiing assumed, but what I do say is, that the subject is not worth the candle of genius, and in point of morality, not fit for public exhibition. The closing* scene of these men's mistaken career is pitiable in the extreme. Half insane from want of rest ind the constant apprehension of being caught, ami more than half stupid with drink, gro(;si|inly mined, and utterly reckless either of their own worthless lives, or those of jvrii-c -li!o ana useful members of society, t!i y .ir,j). .iv more like madmen than any iJiing i-l-i-. The scene is one of lawless ness, turbulence, and bloodshed, und who would wish to see it rep.odm.ed ? There is nothing directly immoral inCamille or Jack Shepherd, and mauy other plays of that class, hut the scenes ure impure, and the un doubted effect is to inflame the worst passions of men. The wretched petroleu-aes who only set fire to houses in the days of the Paris Commune, were shot down without mercy, women as they were. What punishment do men deserve who, if aware of it, in no time of excitement, and in their seber senses, Bet on fire of hell the imagina'iona of the oung, and the passions of lawless men ? In holding up the mirror to nature, the artist must be very skilful, or, as is well known, the effect which he, laudably enough perhaps, wishes to show in its truth, is very apt to be reversed, and it is only the greatest artists that can be trusted in depicting, in all their truth and moral ugliness, the more horrible scenes of human life, or the more disgusting phases of human character. Even Shakespere does not always succeed, and many of his plays have been, on that account, banished from the stage. And if the genius and experience of the greatest dramatist the world ever saw was unequal to the task, is it not foolhardy .of any : young author to make the attempt, even granting that hia intentions are as good as can' be? In all seriousness and earnestness, no mattter whether from the "" love of virtue"" or not, I would say to theaulhor, "" Don't'' There is yet time to withdraw the play. Such a course would still be a graceful act of deference to the feelings of the many, and is the judgment of the few tiue friends he still has, as well as saving Invercargill the disgrace of ap pearing to be about the fastest city of the colon j. — I am, &c, Vox Populi.

On March 3rd last the petition was advertised in the Western Star, but the promoters, finding out that it did not satisfy the requirements of the Counties Act, delayed presenting it to the County Council until more signatures could be obtained. It was pub lished a second time on the 6th of June, and on Friday, 17th August, was presented to the County Council. A protest against the recep tion was sent in by Mr Officer and myself on the ground that it did not convey the present opinion of the ratepayers, as it was a year or more since many or most of the names were appended, and that during the interval circum stances had occurred—noteably the passing of the Counties Amendment Act, giving the rate ; payers power to escape having two local I bodies, with nearly concurrent powers, in another way than by merging, viz., by sus ( pending the o Deration of the Counties Act and j devolving the functions of the Cotiucil upon | the Road Board—which had caused many to I alter their minds. The County Council, how | ever, lias thought proper to accept the petition j instead of referring it back to the ratepayers. This is one of those cases in which the letter ; of the law may have been complied with, while the spirit and intention has been evaded. Tbo Act does not specify a limit within which the names must be affixed to the | petition before presentation, and it appears 1 that so far as' the letter of the law goes a petition signed five years ago or more might be accepted. In this respect the Act is dofec ! tive. Any one who is impartial can see that ' it is not fair to bind a person to an opinion : given a year or more ago, when during the 1 interval he has obtained better information on | the subject, or when, as in this particular case, ; the conditions upon which he based his opinion ; have been entirely changed by subsequent legislation. The members of the County j Council are understood to be in favor of merging, butif they think that by taking advan tage of this obsolete and spurious, though legal, petition they will attain their object through ratepayers not going to the expense and trouble of a counter petition, it is to be hoped they are mistaken. Though a majority was returned to the Road Board at the late election favorable to merging, this cannot be taken as any proof that the majority of rate j payers arc in favor of it, because it was the plural property votes which secured the majo rity, it being well known that nearly all the large landholders wish to extinguish the Road Board, perhaps in the expectation of being able under the County to save themselves from | being rated for dist ict roads, which they do I not themselves make use of, regardless of the ! interests of the smaller landowners, who do | use and require these roads. I must not now I trespass further on your space, but in my | next letter I purpose to show that merging ! will not lead to any saving, unless it is by | depriving the smaller landowners of necessary I local improvements on district roads, and that it will deprive them of the control of their own local affairs and subject them practically to the domination of larger landowners. In conclusion, I may remind your readers that on this question I am in harmony with our leading public men, whether Centralists or anti-Centralists. For example, the present Minister of Justice, Mr Oonolly, in a late speech in the House of Representatives praises the Road Boards, and says that in the late Province of Marlborough tiiey have been found equal to do all necessary works, the Counties Act of 1876 never having been put in force there.—Yours truly, Sajil.

He had only ap preciation enough of the grand and noble to appreciate himself for having admired it. The mind alone never gives one the highest appreciation of the noble and sublime ; the heart must first accept it — we must feel as well as understand. Fergus' heart was only large enough to hold himself, and like a glutton devours food to please his own palate, so he devoured the produce of other minds simply for his own glorification, not with the purpose of making bone and muscle and by it achieve fame to the gain of others. Donald, the herd boy, was a poet born ; therefore, nature and mankind found a place in his heart, and from such material he con structed what his genius gave forth. Talent uses to the best advantage the production of other minds ; genius does that also, but also from thai material builds new things, and in nature and mankind finds it 3 creative power Fergus had not much talent even, for ho could not use to the best the grain grown on other stalks ; ""He mistook also sensibility for faculty."" Feeling without thought is a ship without a helm ; without the guide of reason feeling seldom reaches a much-to-be desired port. ""Ambition is the shadow of aspiraHqn, Truly! forwhile aspiration has its face to wardsheavenambition trails along the ground Who so regardless of casting gloom as the truly ambitious man 7 On he goes, over every thing, no matter from whom he shuts out In the words "" Man xi made to be that ■which he is made most capable of desiring "" is a field for a life's study. No wonder, then, w hen the heart desires and loves the highest —the real substance of beauty and good— the shadows of it only darken and baffle the soul. Made to be the highest we have ever dreamed in those glad hours when the heart and soul first woke up to itself, and, if made to be, could have been I No wonder one feels debased— so far, far off. Be thy best aspiration I what a clarion-call to mortal ! J3ut ""no man can order his life, for it comes flowing over him from behind,"" says Mac donald. The one secret of life and development is not to devise and plan, but to fall in with the forces at work— to do every moment's duty aright — that being the process allotted to us : and let come what will, for there is no such thing, but what the Eternal Thought wills for each of us. Thus palling, not against, but with the current, the highest, the noblest, the best is developed in us. Beautiful it is te trace the deep love of humanity with which the author's heart over flows in the working out of the characters. If experience has been his teacher Mac donald has learned from ""suffering, sad humanity"" that by human love and sympathy alone can the sin-stained and sorrow stricken be brought to realise that love can reach out its hands, lay them upon defilement, draw it to be washed, and bless. He makes his men and women human in their sins and sorrows, and his finest characters exalted above the others by the strength and power, the heroic endurance of love, from whence flow charity, pity, pardon, and help. ""Sir Gibbie"" is a work of art, for it is an expression of beauty. The heroic, noble, self-sacrificing, are typified in its pages, and, as in ""Robert Falconer,"" the author deals only with the dark side of human nature to bring out the light in brighter relief. There is no dabbling in the mud for the sake of dabbling in it, but to find the pearl at the bottom, and to show how fine are the elements that struggle with sin. If we were perfect there would be no reaching upward. The goal once reached aspiration would die, but Macdonald'e goal for man is in the word Godlike. Macdonald's are works of art, for they are things of unity. He has one grand centre round which all else revolves. There is no unconnectedness, the whole is developed from an inner thought, and the disposing of the characters, the plot, all are the develop ment of that inner thought which is — love and pardon, as being the source of all strength and effort. When the author has to do with imperfections his censure is so based on the love of the beautiful that his desire, man's highest good, is everywhere plain. There is no gloating over the shadows. Alongside the picture of deformity runs the thought of what might be, and the artist never descends to the level he condemns, or runs foul of the rocks he points out to others. His war is not against the vicious and criminal, but against vice and crime, not against the sinner but the sin. An uncommon crusade. Of the love of woman Macdonald has the highest conception, regarding in it an incen tive to great and noble ends, and the guiding star of his life.",Fiction

Srß, — The question of the greatest im portance discussed at the late Geraldine election was that of deferred payments for land, and is one that demands our best con sideration, as affecting in a material degree the commercial future of the colony. A few re marks may not, therefore, be out of place in your columns. The subject has been considered with re ference to population and revenue, and there are interests that may be affected or injured by the change in a temporary •sense, but to the permanent result of legislation we should direct our attention, if we are really anxious to arrive at a sound and enlightened con clusion. There is an apparent unanimity with re gard to the desirability of a greatly increased population, as being indispensable to rapid , progress. We have a fiue climate, and agrir cultural laud in almost boundless quantity — oapible of sustaining a vast population— which the plough has not disturbed. Wo have great mineral wealth, only requiring the application of labor and capital to add t<> our trade and prosperity; and other- valu able resources to be made available by a largo population. We have also a large national ! debt, which we must divide and subdivid ; by increasing our numbers, if we are to bj permanently prosperous. We should endeavour to place before the old country, and Europe, as attractive :* prospectus as we can. We are competing for the surplus population, especially with tho United States, nnd also other parts of the world. In Kurope, the prices of land are well known, of th« various countries inviting populations, as well as the amount) of taxa tion, the rate of lal»>r. tho market value of agricultural commodities, and other similar particulars, and are minutely weighed in the balance. Jet urn ask, is it likely or rational, after Eiich au examination, that we can expect any more than a Hmall proportion of the hundreds of thousands who leave Europe annually for distant homes, having . to pay an increased coat of ivuieagn, a tre bly prolonged voyage partly through the tropiw, to prefer New Zealand, where land is higher and corn lower than in any part of the tho world ? Can we expect they will, in any numbers, give £'2 an acre for land in Canterbury, when they can buy it for a fifth [wirt of that sum, with deferred i«ymenta, in the United States, with its navigable rivers, its network of railways, abundant capital, and natural advantages superior to ours I The subject, therefore, stand* thus : — ln reference to population, we are competing with other couniriea on unequal and disad vantageous terms. It is usaleas to he con stantly reiterating the outcry that our great want is a larger popnlation, and allow our present land laws to operate bo powerfully against it. It has been said, 'deferred pay ments have failed elsewhere ;' if so, it is pro bably from some imperfection in the regula tions or law respeotmg them. It is sufficient to say the system has answered admirably in the .United States, and after a trial of year* is still existent We need not be ashamed to copy from a country that has had ages of experience, and perhaps the great fortune to be governed better than any country in the world.

A few pound* here licoe come to heed, miking the total of subscriptions £BOO. Permit me to make an earnest appeal for a more free and generous support I am sure none of the friends of the late Mr Moorhouse can forget the service* he rendered to Canterbury } on every occasion where loyal eemce was re* qutred he was foremost. If it be asked (which it cannot surely be)—What has he done f let me remind such persons of Lyttelton and Christchurch tunnel and the railway. Where would the commerce of the plains We been but for his perseverance in the matter P What again of the Public Works policy of New Zealand ? Every man in business, even those who knew him not, is a* much eon* corned in this as his personal friends. Then there is that most enjoyable of all enjoyable places—the Domain and its beautiful garden# j the Museum, the Hospital, and all their surroundings. Again, wao first set our tele* graph wires in motion P Surely, when the answer is William Sefton Moorhouse, there is osuse for wonder that the subscriptions for the purpose I advocate do not roll in oon* •iderably in exerts of our requirements, I miss the names of some old friend* on my list. I see others contributing a solitary guinea, who have benefited by ms work to the extent of thousands. The proposed statue is intended as aa im* perishable memorial of the man, and as this is a last appeal, so let me hope that it will be Übsrally responded to. Instructions have been sent to Messrs Miles Brea., of London, and knowing their promptitude with every work they take in hand, a very short period will now elapse before the final order will have to be given. I vntreat my old friends not to prevent the completion of this solemn commission by any longer withholding their assistance. Be doubles bis «lft, who gives In Urn*. Let everyone who has promised one guinea, give two i and he who has promised two, give three j and five, seven. Then the diffl eulty is solved. —1 am, Ac., J. OLLtVIEB.",LetterToEditor

'It is itillioult to BDeek about Buoh things, but you kno^ tlsat I -would do anything to save yon psin — ' ' Go on,' and now her eyes ware fixed on tho minister. 'It came to ruyrers end I saw for myself that one whom 1 knew slightly and did not liko ivas paying yon e,tton« tions, and it might be, as I also heard, was favored by you.

' You rocoraruond mo to marry Mr I Criißuaw, if that Ronflcinan nhould do 1 me the honor to nnkiny Iwd, or do you propose to suggest this step to him, so as to oomplfate your duty as guardian P ' Mrs Arkwright was now standing and regarding Egerton with (ierco scorn, _ ' My Information seemed to be reli able '—ho was also standing, white and pained— 'and I thought it would help yon in that case to know what I have told you, when you came to decide.' 'If I knew who told you such false hoods, I would never opeak to iheiu again, and I would ra&ko them sailor for their words. Mr Crjslmw ! aud it was to that cynicnl, worldly i.iilor'.i block you woro to marry mo. What ill have I dono to you ?

' Bccnuso I do not earn what any por son in this town or all Yorkshire says about mo, but I do care and cannot en dure that you should turn against me, and bo content to see me Crashaw 's wife or any other man's.' And she chased the minister across the room in her wrath — he had never seen her so beauti ful—till he stood with his baok to the door, and she before him as a lioness robbed of her cubß. ' It has been my mistake for I under stand not women,' he said with proud humility. ' I beg your pardon, and am more than ever— your servant.' She looked at him sternly for ten seconds; then she turned away. 'If that is all you have to say, you ueed not come again to this house.' ' You will excuse my sending a verbal message by the doctor, for, as you coo, I am past writing, ana — the time is short, I wanted to speak with you, Mrs Ark wright onoe before I died.' And Egerton thought of the day she had stood by her husband's deathbed 8b now she stood by his, only that the nurse had left the room and thore was no third person to be an embarrassment. ' Do not suppose I forget your words to me the last tiniu we met In private,' he continued, as she did not speak nor look at him, beyond one swift glance as she came into the room ; ' and believe me, I would not have foroed myself on you, nor would I have asked this favor, had It not beon that— l have something of which I must deliver my soul. 1 ' You are not dying ; you were a strong man, and a few days' illness couldn't — be fatal.' she burst out, and it seemed as if Mra Arkwright for onca was going to lose control aud fall a weeping. Then ahe mastered herself, and said alaios ; coldly, ' Had I known you were so ill T would have called to inquire ; but nothiDg was said ol pneu monia, only a bad cold.' ' Yo>. forgive me, then, that 111-judged interference, Mrs Arkwright, and any thing else in which I have offended you or failod in— my brother's purt p' ' Do not spoak to me like that unless you wish to take revenge ; it is I who ask \our pardon for my evil tempar and iur.olauce that day, »ud other times ; but you are too — good, eh>> you would have understood.' ' You did not, then, hate me, as I sopposod ?

' And when she raised his head her hands lingered as they had not done before on her husband's. 'Are you really dying?' She sat down and looked at him, her head between her hands. ' You and I are, at least, able to face the situation.' ' Yes, without doubt ; but I am not a tnar:yr to overwork, or anything else. Do not let any one speak of me in that fashioo ; I simply caught a cold aud did Dot take care of it. It's quite oommonplace.' When he smiled his face was at it's best, the dark blue eyes having a roguish look as of a boy. Mm Arkwright leaned back on her ohair and bit hor lower lip. 'This is good-by, and our friendship — six long years, isn't itj' — ia over. End I known it was to be ao short — well, we had Dot quarreled.' ' Not ovsr,' and he looked at her wist fully ; ' this life does not end all.' 1 All, you have tku old romantio faith, and one would like to share it ; but no one knows ; this life is the only cer tainty.' 1 In a few houra,' he went on, ' I shall know, aud I expeot ao se« my friend John Arkwright, whom I loved, al though we only knew one another for about three years, and lia -will ask for you.' Mrs Arkwright regarded Egorton with amazement. ' Ho will ask how I kept ivy t^'ist, and I— will be ashsmod, ranges you heur my confession and forgive me. For I have sinned againat yau and your hus band.' 'In what?' she asked with a hard voice. ' Gad knows that 1 had no tUught of you ho might nut have read while hn wat. ht-re.

'Andno'v?' She had risen to her feet. 'I have finally overcome, but only within these few daya, aud my heart is as last single. You are to mo again ruy friend's wife, and I shall meet him In peace— if you forgivo me.'

Minnie dining the. two days he remained in. town, and ho augured from this that things were progressing favorably, and she would not prove recalcitrant, after all. Bis mortification and rage may be imagined better than described, when, on presenting himself, at the stated time, at Mrs Tredgetfc's door, he learnt that Minnie had gone into the country, and it was not known when she would be back. All his efforts to obtain some clue to her whereabouts were fruitless. On this he went back to the cab he had kept waiting at the corner of the street, and bade the man drive him to the Charing Cross station. At the bottom of this sudden dis appearance he saw Gwendolyn, and the ia.ct that she had got hold of Minnie startled him. He knew his cousin's implacable naiure ; her bitter purpose as regarded himself ; and realized that Minnie's sudden disappearance had a terrible meaning he must not ignore. And yet his; thoughts turned rest fully to home. Lie would recruit his exhausted energies in Maggie's com pany, and then begin his uncompromis ing search after the woman who had evaded him so skilfully. What was the good of his money to him if he must live in hourly dread of her pre sence and claims ? But one gianco of Maggie's honest blue eyes would be his best comfort and stay. The sun was setting as he neared Faruborough, and the mountain taps were flushed wii.h rosy color. The birds sang on every branch and hedge ; the cooi ripple of water tilled the autumn air. Captain Gross was soothed in spite of hiiuse.lf. The tangled web he had begun to weave grew to be the burden- \ some sequence, of a first fault, and he longed to bo free and innocent otfee again. ' Worthy of her T murmured a secret voice in his ear, — w worthy of the t>cst and purest woman that was ever born "" If [ had bub known her eailier, what a different life mine must nt-eds have been • I wonder if six.- will come out | to meet me. and welcome m«» lio-jic V i Seeing a shadow cross the lawn suggested this last mental question ; but the shadow went on, and so did he, | both going different ways.

Captain dross smiled complacently. He liked to feel that he was being generally recognised by the county. Hurrying upstairs, he tapped softly at the drawing-room door. ' May I come in, Aunt Jane f j Ho answer. i Another tap had no better result, and so he pushed open the door, and glanced in. There was some fancy-work lyinc about, an open book, a sheet of copied music. It could *be seen that the room had been occupied lately by a culti vated woman ; but there was no special token of Maggie's presence, and for this only he was looking. He drew back at last with a sigh of disappointment, and went out into the grounds. When he came to the rustic seat hy the waterfall, he found Mrs j Gross — but Mrs Gross alone. I She sprang forward at his approach, ; and held our. both her hands. j ' My dear Martin, 1 am so delighted to see you ! But was not your train very early V j 4 No, aunt j ifc was only true to its i time, for a wonder. But where is Maggie? Not. ill, I hop-?' ' Oh, dear, no ! At least, I believe not,' she stammered out, with an air of embarrassment that sent a vague, pro phetic chill to his very heart. ' She went home this morning.' ' Went home this morning V repeated Martin, half incredulously. ' How was that V ' She thought our old servant might not to be alone any longer,' replied Mrs Gross, who was very lame at excuses, and looked guilty to the last degree. ' Newton Vale is a dull place, you know.' . : That was all the more reason for remaining here,' he replied, in a tone of resentment she at once perceived, j c Besides, I think my cousin owed me | even more consideration than was due to her nurse, since 1 am a relative.' I ' Maggie meant to do what was right, Martin. 3 'I never denied that, Aunt Jane; but a little reflection would have made j her alter her plans.' j Mrs Gross colored faintly, 'She did reilect -' ' So this was a premeditated slight? ' Nay, my dear Martin ; it was not a slight at all. Maggie is very sensi tive, and does not like to think that she is the subject of unpleasant re mark's. That is the truth, and I think '■ she is right,' concluded Mrs Gross, for -5 getting, in her anxiety to defend her i child, that she had not considered this ' step at all necessary herself. 'Who has dared to make remarks, • j then ? inquired Martin, passionately. » I ' Nay, it does not matter now,' she ' j answered, with gentle dignity. ' Mag ' j gis is at home by this time, and I shall » | follow her as soon as you can spare ' ! me, Martin.' I 'Then you wonld desert me, too, ►Jaunt?' And his voice was full of 1 , suppressed emotion. ' 'My dear, Ido not desert you. I have a home of my own, and must re ; turn to it sooner or later, of course.' ' Why ? This question posed Mrs Gross. 1 , There was no particular reason for 1 returning to Newton Vale, only that ; she must follow Maggie, whose woman's 1 instinct had hitherto proved a very ; safe guide. ' j ' Well, I cannot always live upon j you, Martin. If I were alone in the - world ifc would be a different thing ; but Maggie must be my first considera tion, and I do not think she could live at Farnborough without exposing her self to unpleasant remarks.' | ' They would not last Jong, at any i rate, since I fully intend to ask her to Le my wife.' j Mis Gross's face brightened, and then as suddenly fell. She could not . feel at all sure of Maggie's answer; and it' this offer were refused, ifc would make an irreparable breach between them. In tiiis perplexity she said, after consideration, ' I would wait a little while if 1 were you. Maggie is not accustomed to regard you in the light of a lover as yet, and would not be sure of her own feelings.' ' But. yon think I may have a chance of winning her ifl am patient? in quired Martin, eagerly. Mrs Gross hesitate;! a moment, and then answered, in a decided tone, ' I feel sure thafc you will. Maggie has a very tender heart, aud sho is already touched by your kindness to inc. Only you must wait awhile.' ' How long? 1 A month fiom this time come down and see us at Newton Yale. 1 shall know then whether there is hope, and wiil tell yo,u the ltui.h without dis giii?«.- ---' And may ] count upon your using yonr'iniluoneo in mv behalf? ' T will do the best I can for you, indirectly ; but I dare not make it a favor to me. that she should become - your wife, for if x| u > were unhuppv afterwards it would hres-ik mv heart.' ** IJ.er life .shall be one long hoiid-iv,' he said, vehemently. 'You must see how dearly I love her.' ' I am afraid o. lover's raptures do ' not count for much,' she said, with . indulgent irony. ' But I give you credit for being sincere at the present I time, and Maggie is wise and true ; I one might always trust her to keep ;. what she has won.' j 'Dear Maggie!' murmured Martin, involuntarily. 'If I had but known her earlier !' 'You talk like an old man whose past is shadowed by sorrow and regret.' said Mrs Gross, looking searchingly afc her nephew. j liis eyes drooped, the color deserted i his face. The accusation had taken him unawares, and he had no Lime to compose his features to meet her gaze. Then he laughed nervously. ' I had great temptations in my youth, Aunt Jane, and- I had not al ways the strength to withstand them For instance, I gambled, and ran into debt. But my debts are paid already, and I will willingly guarantee never to touch a card or dice after Maggie be comes niy wife, if she and you wish it.' ' Ancl there is nothing more than this- to tell mc? I ' Nothing more,' he repeated, ! steadily ; and now he had recovered . himself, and looked at her without j flinching. ' What should there be ? I 'No foolish entanolenn.nt or love | affair, such as foolish youths often fall j into ? j ' No. I never cared two straws for any woman until I saw Maggie.' ' Then she is your first love. !' ' My first and only love, Aunt Jane.' 'I wish I knew what was for the best,' said Mrs Gross, anxiously. ' Why, aunt, it is best that Maggie should marry me,' he said, stooping to smile into ber troubled eyes. ' Why should you doubt it ! This secures your being together for the rest of your life, you two, and is thafc nothing gained ? ' Yes : but I must Le sure that it' is rightly gained.' He felt inclined to ciir.se her scruples ; they obtruded themselves so very suddenly and inopportunely. A minute ago he hacl felt sure that the prize would eveutually be his, and now he was plunged once more into the ' slough of despond.' He could have humbled himself at Mrs Gross's very feet to make sure of her as his ally, for he knew that she would be the most powerful he could obtain. But he was politic enough not to urge her too far. Patting ou a resigned air, he said, ** You must think of Maggie first ; and as her happiness is also my chief consideration, we are not likely to disagree on that point. Bn*, anyhow, do not leave me until 1 get accustomed to my grandeur. Then is son*- *tbing in all this magnificence that chilis me. Farnboioigh will uever serin like home until I have a wife,' 1 Ancl you ought to marry at once ; it is natural and proper. There are plenty of girls in the neighborhood, whom if you knew better ' ' I should like less,' he interrupted quickly. 'Aunt Jane, you would not have me believe that any of them come up to Maggie 1 ?' ' No,' she answered, candidly. *■ Still, when one cannot get what one likes, one must like what one can get.' ' I thought you bade me hope just vow T 'So I do still ; but in case of disap pointment ' Again he interrupted her. ' I never look on the dark side if T. can help it. It is time enough to despair when I can no longer hope. 5 ' J ust so,' she answered, in a relieved tone. 'I am glad you are so sensible, . my dear. Now let us drop the subject, . if you please. Discussing it can do no good, and only worries us both, since Maggie can alone settle it. I will stay at Farnborough another fortnight if you like ; but unless you really need my presence, 1 should be glad to get back to Maggie.' ' Then you shall go, aunt. It is better that J should be alone than a beautiful young girl,' he said, with an unselfishness that brought back all her old, warm feelings towards him. She did not know, of course, that Martin' hacl suddenly remembered that Minni-'s disappearance threatened pos sible complications which might reach his aunt's cars. Or, tlie girl, under Gwendolyn's advice, had, perhaps, planned a visit to Farnborough, and a grand tableaux that would suit her theatrical instincts better than it wonld suit Mrs Gross's soberer views. There fore it was Letter, no doubt, that he should be alone just for the present, to ascertain how he stood with regard to Minnie ere ho compromised himself in another quarter. But he and his aunt parted on the best of terms. ' You will see me at Newton Vale in a month's time,' be snid, as he grasped her hand in both of his. 'Do not let Maggie quite forget nic, mean while."" Mrs Gross smiled. 'You must think she has a short iui-'moiy.' * Do not a lover's fears excite your sympathies ns much as a lover's ruptures? he asked, with rather an utt easy laugh. ' Ah ! now we nre going back to the raptures again.' * Whicli yon do not disapprove, ' he said, slily. ' J think tliey are premature, Martin.' 'That is true,' lie replied, witli a very audible, sigh. ' But if T had your wise bead on my foolish shoulder-*-, I should only be a curiosity, aunt, and so 1 must try and wait for my wisdom awhile.' He felt somewhat depressed, in spite of himself, as he went back into the house, and to the lonely, silent rooms, so magnificently gloomy for one occu pant. The evening shadows were beginning to darken over the gloss of satin and white gleam oE lace, and the marble nymph in one of the niches looked like a ghost as he seated himself on one of the couches, and burying his face in : his hands, gave himself up to sombre thought. None of the servants knew of his return, and he did not care to riuo- the bell. The, light oozed awaj""-, leaving the marble nympth a white outline against the black shadow, and still Martin did not move. Presently a light wind rustled the curtains, and the. window, slowly open ing, showed a dark figure wavering irresolutely against the lighter back ground of the moonlit sky. A dull moan went through tho air, and Martin, hearing it in his sleep, fancied it must he the hoarse voices of' his enemies in sharp pursuit, and gave a faint cry. ' Even here !' he muttered, in his sleep. ' Why can't they leave me alone 1 ? I have done no worse, than others, after all ! The will is ' But even in slumber a keen instinct warned him away from this subject, and he went on, with a mysterious smile, ' It- will Le all right if she marries nie — at least, all right for her ! It does not matter for the rest I' And, with a reckless little laugh, ' Charity begins at home !' A hand, soft as satin, passed to and fro before his closed eyeballs, and then w;is gently pressed against his fore head. The effect was magical. He began to talk wildly, almost in coherently, until a faint whisper, like the balmy breath of the summer wind, caressed his ear. ' The will is -' Martin finished the' sentence with a cool langh. 'In the: fire, I should fancy ! Who the deuce are you, and what do yon mean by humbugging a fellow in this fashion ? There was a swift, faint rustle— -a movement amongst tlie shadows— -tho slightest perceptible swaying of the lace curtains — and then Martin knew that, even if this presence he had vaguely realised had been real, it was gone now, and thafc its next visit would be more cautiously managed, and leave, some deeper trace behind. ■(To be Continued.)",Fiction

Without, the wide park was growing rapidly dark beneath the curtain of grey cloud which, hiding the winter sunset, was fast overspreading the sky. Within, firelight already glowed warmly in the long picture gallery ; and as the fitful gleams fel on the pictured wall, faces of deadl L'Estranges shone out with sudden life. She had curled herself up comfortably on one of the broad window Beats, and pressing her cheeks against the cold glass, watched — for what was best known to herself, Soon she became a subject of speculation among the merry group whom she had deserted ; who had clutterd themselves round one of the large fires which blazed at either end of the gallery. "" Gertrude, why are you sitting out in the cold ?"" '• Gertrude, have we offended you ?"" ' ; Miss Melville, do comeback."" "" Gertrude, what are you looking at ?"" "" Miss Melville, shall I come and help you ?"" Such were the questions they tossed over to her ; but few of them were answered. Only now aud then she fired back a sharp one ; "" What does it matter to you ?"" "" I shall get cold if I like."" "" Leave me alone I"" Andsoafcer a time they did, and their laughter and gay voices rang unheeded on her ear. She never stirred, or moved her eyes from the white carriage road, which grew less and less distinct every moment. Now the wind began to sigh and moan through the huse branches of many a forest king ; and a flake of snow came fluttering down with a wavering, lingering motion fol lowed by another, and another ; until the air was full of them. Then, through the rising storm, Gertrude's ears caught a sound of horses' hoofs coming along at a rapid, swing ing trot ; her heart leaped up, and the colour deepened ; while a light, not of the dancing blaze, shone in her dark brown eyes. She strained her gaze through the thickening snow, and the last glimmer of daylight showed her a man on horseback at the door below. Then she made a sudden movement, as if she would join the others, but a second thought stopped her, and she returned to her old positton ; but the eager eyes were satis fied, and the ear was strained now to catch that footstep with such music in its fall. The door opened and it was there. "" Ah, Miss L'Estrange, how cheerful you look ! How do you do ?"" A tall man, with broad shoulders and a deep voice, with a strong Scoth accent in it, had found the group at the fire. Every hand was ready to meet that of David Gower. "" Cold ? I should think so ! A regular snowy Christmas."" And then his eye began to rove ; he missed something from the circle round him. "" Gertrude,"" called Eva L'Estrange, ""here's your ' particular friend.' Come out of the cold, child."" His bright blue eyes lightened, and went straight as an arrow to the place where she was sitting ; then he followed them. "" In the cold ?"" he se:d, and his voice softened exquisitively. "" I'm not cold. Mayn't I watch the snow if I like ?"" "" No, little one ; come to the fire."" And she came. "" A little one "" indeed, beside height and breadth. As the firelight shines on her face, let us see what it is like. Not strictly beautiful by any means, com pared with Miss JL'Estrange's regular fea tures ; but very fair to look upon, thought David Gower. The nose was not straight, but it was delicately shaped. The imperfect mouth was always either bewitchingly merry or seriously sweet. The brown hair and eyes were soft and bright ; the low, broad brow as pure as ivory. Women invariably called her plain, but most men thought her pretty. To David Gower she was beautiful. The circle opened to let her in, but she was not a favourite with them. She was too easily offended and sharp with her answers for the girls, and too distant and independent for the men. But David was her particular friend. He had lately become a large landholder in the neighbourhood, and farmed it himself. Ex tremely clever in agriculture, he became Mr L'Estrange's right-hand in such matters, and grew so popular with the people that Mr L'Estrange, who hoped to be returned for the county at the coming election, found in David Gower a man of great power and influence, and cultivated him accordingly. All that was known of his parentage was that bis father, who was now dead, had been a Pres byterian minister. David became a great favourite in the hall, and nearly everybedy called him by his Christian name ; it seemed to come so naturally, perhaps because he was so simple, honest, and straightforward in his ways. And so it was that Gertrude Melville, coming to stay at her uncle's house, had taken it into her wilful little head that no thing on earth would please her but to ride a rough pony every day of her life over the fields and roads with David Gower. "" Really it is not proper,"" objected Mrs L'E9trange. "" Pooh ! old David is like a father,"" re plied her husband ; "" let the child alone ; it does her good."" And she was ""let alone,"" after a brief re monstrance from her aunt, to which she re plied, "" I don't care to ride properly, with a groom behind me. And I mustn't hunt ; but David often goes over hedges and ditche.i, and that is what I like. It's all light, aunt Ellen 1"" So over hedges and ditches Miss Gertrude went to her heart's content— but not to David's — for he became so dreadfully alarmed for that pretty, slender neck, that it was a great relief to him when she gradually be came less and less attached to "" cross coun try "" riding, and took to liking quiet canters down lonely lanes ; and still better when she grew tired even of a canter, and their horses walked slowly side by side, and long, long talks beguiled the flying hours. The fairy beauty of the frosty morning, the roar of the forest trees, the bare branches that would bud again in spring-time, the dead-leaved earth, whioh only slept, had for them elo quent teachings ; voices that spoke low, and near to their hearts ; until strange silences used to fall between them, as they rode side by side through the wintry land. Somehow Gertrude was changed. Her wildness had departed, she was softer and gentler. Until Mr L'Estrange triumphantly inquired of his wife whether David Gower; had done any harm. "" No, unless she has fallen in love with him."" To which her wise husband replied with a laugh of contempt, ""In love with him ? Why, my dear, David is not the sort of fellow girls fall in love with, I can tell you."" But Mrs L'Estrange might be supposed to know a little more about the matter than he did. She knew a very short road to a woman's heart, with which David Gower in all unconsciousness seemed to be very well acquainted ; and that was, a gentleness of manner, and an air of protecting strength, which made you turn to him in trouble, and feel ready to face any danger by his side. Therefore; when this change came over Gertrude, her aunt felt much relieved to think her visit was nearly at an end. But alas for the "" little one 1"" She crouched down in her corner by the fire, and gazing on the face of her "" particular friend"" as he talked with the others, kept saying over to herself with a miserable despair — "" Only a week more J Only a week more ! O, I cannot, cannot go away !"" And ehe repeated aloud, "" I cannot, and I will not 1"" "" O, dear me, Gertrude, what an awful little witch you are !"" exclaimed Eva ; "" she is talking to herself in a most dreadful man* ne:, Mr Gower."" Poor Gertrude grew crimson to her fore head, and in another moment tears would have blinded her frightened eyes, for twelve bantering remarks were addressed to her at once ; but David came to her assistance saying, "" They shall not tease you ! They dare not, if I protect you."" Gertrude recovered herself and laughed. "" I was half asleep, I think,"" she said; "" firelight does make one so sleepy. Eva, it must be time to dress for dinner."" But she did not look up or speak to him who wrs standing by her side. And as the circle broke up she went soberly away with the other girls, leaving him thoughtful and silent, with the gentlemen by the fire. A very deep fit of thoughtfulness indeed seemed to have fallen upon David Gower, and he sat through the long dinner almost in silence. His eyes were always wandering down the table to where a light figure in a white dress, with variegated holly in her hair, sat on the other side. Now and then, he saw how her eyes seemed to search for his, from which, when they had found them, they dropped or turned away in sweet confusion ; and some one, speaking to him after one of these glances, was struck by the radiant smile that lit up his grand, good face, making it positively handsome.

There are two very simple ways of putting a stop to this nuisance, which has now become intolerable— either appoint someone to keep them in decent order, or, better still, instruct the checktaksrs to refuse them admittance.

He's let himseF into bis cottage, and locked the door ,• and Ilay he's thrown himaeP on his bed, where he'll lie till morning. Oh, he's a bad'un, is old Jeremy."" ' "" He ain't as bad as you think, muther,"" replied little Janey, giving the wet clothes she was handling a tighter wring— for it — g-day, and though Janey had to stand on a little stool to reach the tub com fortably, she was always to be found there, as hard at work as any one. She was called little Janey, but it was size not age that had won her the word, for Janey, though she looked ten, was thirteen if she was a day, and, besides this, was as womanly in her ways as her mother; sickness, poverty, and work, arid many little brothers and sisters to look after, having made her old before her time, whilst her dead father, who had been a ""queer, thoughtful sort o' chap,"" had added to her age by making her queer and thoughtful too. The world to Janey was full of riddles, the answers to which she puzzled over all day long, more or less. "" Oh,"" said Mrs Welcher, •• if faint bad to your thinking fur an old man to lie there dead drunk, I'd like to know what you'd be calling 'bad.'"" ""His habits are bad, but he isn't,"" said Janey, wisely. And that was where she differed from other people. Others saw only the habits of a man ; Janey, taught by her father, sought below, and found the "" man,"" and though there might be but a spark of him left, she fanned that spark, screened it, blew it gently with her sweet breath, and if it went out — but no, to Janev death only put it out ; and what then ? "" God will put a match io him in a better kingdom,"" her father had said ; adding, "" aud there are heavenly bellows there, my Janey,"" for he had been apt to talk a deal of serious nonsense to Janey j nonsense that she believed because she believed in him. But what of old Jeremy ? Mrs Welcher was wrong, and Janey right. Jeremy was not as bad as he looked or was said to be ; but he was swayed by two great influences which daily warred against each other. The one was a •deep and loving gratitude to God for all His ■mercies and long-suffering, the other a great ilove of drink. The one led him to pray, read ■his Bible, ga to church, speak and act like a •Christian > the other drove him to deny him self and his God, and, in his own words, "" make -a beast o' hansel."" Little wonder, then, that <manj- called him ""hypocrite"" and ""bad;"" <asd little wonder, too, that Janey, seeking, $ound two Jeremies, one to pity and help, one fo love and learn from. Well, then, might she give the clothes a tighter wring, when she saw Jeremy stagger past the window, with just wit enough to let himself into his cottage and throw himself upon the bed. •' He'll lie there till morniug,"" said Mrs Welcher, and she was right ; for it was not until the dawn broke and the pale light filtered into his room through tho blind that old Jeremy awoke. He lay still for a few minutes. There seemed •to be a weight upon his mind, a heavy sense of something very wrong or sad. What was it ? What had happened? What had he .done? He raised his head, and, oh dear ! what a pain *hot through it ! ""<O Lord, Lord, I've been and got drunk ••again !"" cried old Jeremy, and the cry had ho Sauch of a prayer about it that quite naturally 5«3 hands flew together and clasped themselves!, whilst his eyes gazed upwards at the ceiling of his room. He lay thus quite silent for five minutes, and then he began to speak aloud, as was his habit. ""But as if Thee didn't know that !"" he said, addressing God ; "" Theo've known it all night, while I've been lying here like a log. O, dear, dear, however wast I did it? Thee knows how 'twas, and I know. 'Twas all along o' hugging them taters fur Mr Clarkson, o' t' White Horse. * Jeremy,' says he, ' hug me these taters to my place, will you ? You look as though you might ba wanting a job.' So I hugs 'em, and says he, 'I'll treat you to a tglass for that.' Ay, it's easy for such like to *reat * man; a glass ain't nowhere to him, but it does a deal o' harm. Moneys best, fur if .you treat yoursel' the responsibility's your •own, and the temptation's o' your own walk ing into ; but fur another to treat you is to run ttead foremost into 't. Lord, why should he hey treated me? I'd liefer had a pocketful o' taters, for here's where it's brought me, and made me make a beast o' mysel' again. O Lord, Lord, to think I should hey gone and done it again,"" he cried, and tears— and no one buc God to see them — rose in his eyes and slid down his cheeks. ""I feel mortal bad about it, Lord. It's bad enough for a young man to make a boast o' hitnseP ; but, O Lord, grey hairs oughter be crowned, not to bo dragging in t' mire. Lord, crown my grey hairs, it it's nobbut wi' thorns. I don't want to do it. Ain't there no *vay that I can show Thee I'm in earnest, fur theo man be sick o' hearing me say I'm sorry. What mun I do? and what will Janey say?"" ' It was this sudden thought of Janoy that stirred him presently to bit up and begin feebly to "" pull himself together."" He thought, too, of lighting the fire, for the sun was shining. and the noises in the yard bespoke that the day's work had begun ; but he felt too sick and dispirited to bother about ifc. What work had he to do ? No one would give him any that day after such a bout, so he might as well keep quiet, he reasoned, and let things blow over a bit before showing himself to the neighbours, who would be ready enough, some to twit, and some to blame, and some to laugh at him. But scarcely had he settled this when some one tapped at the door. "" It's me— Janey,"" cried little Janey through thekeyhale. Old Jeremy got up without a word and let her in — his little judge. Then he closed the door after her, for her hands were full of sticks and paper. "" I've come to light your fire,"" said Janey ; and she went down on her knees accordingly ; whilst Jeremy, sitting down on his favourite old box, watched her and waited anxiously for her to speak. But Janey was silent. The cinders and ashes were raked out, the grate re filled, the sticks lit, the hearth swept, the fender brightened with a few thorough rubs ; but all in silence. Would she go without speaking ! Was he in such disgrace as that ? Had he sinned past even Janey's bearing ? '•Janey,"" said old Jeremy, humbly, almost servilely in fact, "" won't thee say summat ?'' Janey, still on her knees, turned and looked at him. Her eyes rested on and noted every particular of the bent figure, the hoary head, .the furrowed face, the self-dishonoured, de graded whole. "" Oh, Jeremy,"" she said, and turned away her head. The tone was not scornful or angry or reproachful, only disappointed. But that and^her averted look struck into Jeremy's heart as a knife would have struck into his body. It seemed to draw blood. "" I'm sorry,"" he said. "" I know you are,"" said Janey, gently. ""But I've said that a mort o' times, Janey."" Janey shook her head. "" Oh, I know you hey,"" she said. "" It was all orlong o' Clarkson giving me a glass for hugging bis skip full o' taters,"" con tinued Jeremy. "" Not that I'm fur making that an excuse, Janey. I should hey said, ' No, thank you,' to him ; I know I should."" "" But did one glass make you tipsy ?"" Foolish old Jeremy ! He hadn't even told God that, and God couldn't ask him. But Janey could. He did not answer for a minute. He looked all round the room as if invoking help from the chair or table or bed, then at the last his dim eyes were drawn to meet Janey's bright ones. ""As soon as the sperit ran down my throat I felt I mun hey more and more and more. I don't think on, now, Janey, how many glasses I had."" "" Why didn't you get up and come away ?"" "" It were warm and comfortable i' there."" "" And if you'd come home and Bpent your money properly, it 'ud hey been warm and comfortable here,"" said Janey. ""Ay, but I'm nobbut a weak old man, a weak old man,"" said Jeremy, shaking his head to and fro. ""I've been telling t' Lord all about it, he continued; ""I've been praying to Him ever sin' daybreak, and asking Him to show me a way out o' it. I hevn't tolled Him I'm sorry, for He mun be- sick o' hearing me say so. I want to show Him I'm sorry by doing better ; to do summat as'U show Him Im i' earnest. But I don't know t'way."" * I know a way,"" said Janey ; "" there's only one way, as I can see."" Jeremy looked at her eagerly, anxiously. "" Tell me it. Let's hear it,"" he said. "" But you won't like it. You won't do it."" "" Janey, I've just prayed t' Lord to crown my grey hairs, if it's nobbut wi' a crown o' thorns,"" cried Jeiemy, stung by her doubt of him. ,7 Janey, hesitated a moment, then she leaned fearer him, and whispered, ""I'd go into t' union if I were you."" i? aya v 80me one struck Jeremy he could not nave been more roused. He sat erect, a thin flush stole over his aged features, his hands trembled, as with palsy, For the fiist time since ho had known little Janey he looked at her as though he disliked her. "" None on us hoy ever come to that,"" he said angrily. "" I'd liefer go to t' union and see you in t' union clothes than lying here drunk on your bed. There's no di ? graoe in t' union ; but there is i' drink, Jeremy,"" replied Janey, her eyes dilating, her whole person flashing out into such a righteous anger against thin display of false pride that subdued Jeremy at once. ""Don't tell mo to go there,"" he pleaded feebly. Janey dashed the tears from her eyes. ""You said you wanted to show t' Lord you were i' earnest,"" she said. ""You don't want to drink ; but you don't seem to be able to keep from it. You've tried all ways. You've signed t' pledge, and broken it. You've tried only taking a sup now and then. You've kept away from the publics. You've said scores and scores of times you'll never do it again, and still it's no good. And you're an old man, Jeremy ; you'll not livo very long, and I don't want you to die drinking, you as love the Lord so ! O, it' ud be a cruel shame to Him, and you ! You bhould't hey prayed t' Lord to show you a way if you hadn't meant it. You shouldn't hey asked Him fur a crown o' thorns if you hadn't meant to wear it."" ""I should hey liked to choose the thorns. Some prick more'n others ; some are bigger. I'm nobbut a weak old man, Jauey. I should hey liked little thorns,"" said Jeremy. The tears rushed from Janey's eyes, she threw her arms round Jeremy's neck, pressing the dishonoured head for a minute against her heaving breast. "" O, Lord Jesus Christ,"" she cried, "" can't Jeremy have little thorns ?"" and then she got up and ran from the cottage, and Jeremy was left alone. 0, what a long and dreary day that was to Jeremy ! He could not make up his mind to go out, not even to find work, though he knew that by the next day he would have nothinar but coal lett in tho house. For the matter of that, who would give him work ? It was not easy to find. Once he had had plenty of little easy duties found him daily by the clergyman ; but hia habit of drink had giadually deprived him of them all, and he looked so feeble aud old that strangers thought it more of a charity to deny than to give him the work he asked for. Thus, had it not been for little jobs such as Clarkson had offered hira k he would long since have had to break up that cherished ""home of his own"" to which he clung with a poor man's honest affection and self-respect"". And now Janey, Jauey who had respected that pride and understood his aliection, wanted him to give it up for his soul's good. The Lord had put it into her head in answer to his own prayer. The ground seemed to be slipping away from under Jeremy's feet; he could almost wish he had not prayed to know the way. It was very dark, and all the darker when, towards evening, he could not help thinking longingly of the drink which had been his curse. It was then that, after a struggle, he got up and went out. Wheie now was Janey ? Jeremy crept pa;>t her door and went slowly up the street. At tho corner stood the ""Black Swan,"" the light from its gas and fires stream ing over the pavement. Jeremy stopped and looked in at the window. A few men were gathered at the bar. Two or three steady ones who took their one glass, enjoyed it, joined in the talk, and went home none the worse but even better for their evening out ; others, hard drinkers like Jeremy himself, who Bhould have shunned such places as they would have shunned hell. "" O, deary me,"" thought Jeremy, "" why was ever drink made ? What a fine lot of men and women there'd be that ain't fine noways now. It seem* a pity we should hey to be tempted wi' sike a thing. It's a sad pity and yet t'would be hard on others who take it i' moderation to hey to do wi'out it altogether. T'were selfish to wish it. But I could wish it wi' all my heart. Janey says, saya she, ' you should hurry past 'em.' Hurry ! It's easy to talk o' hurrying wi' young legs."" He paused, thinking over many of Janey's sayings, and above all of the one of that morn ing. "" I don't want you to die o' drinking, you who love the Lord so. It 'ud be a cruel shame to Him and you."" ""So t'would, so t'would,"" cried Jeremy, aloud. Some people passing by looked at him curiously, aud one man pushing into the inn stopped to speak. '* Ain't you coming in, Jerry ?"" he asked. "" No, no, no,"" said Jeremy, and he turned away, tottering into the darkness of the ill lighted street. The minster clock was striking nine when he returned home. He stopped at Mrs Welcher's door as he passed, and tapped. "" Can I hey <*, word wi little Janey?"" he asked humbly. "" Little Janey's i'bsd. Taint likely she'd want to chatter wi' you this time o' night,"" screamed back Mrs Welcher. "" 0, mother, I'm not i'bed, cried Janey, and before Mrs Welcher could atop her she had run to the door and unlocked it. Jeremy drew aside, holding her littlo hand tight. > . "" I've been and done it,' hd whispered ; ""Mr Smith's given me an order right away into t'house. I'll go in to-morrow, I think I can go in if you'll lead me there, Janey. Will't lead me there ?"" It was Janey's turn now to sacrifice herself. "" 0, Jeremy,"" she said, "" must I ? 0, it'll be hard. I love you so, I shall miss you so."" ""You will? That's good hearing. Taint many as'll miss old Jeremy. But will thee lead me there ? I think I can go through wi' it then."" ""0, I'll lead you. I'll go wi' you. You won't think me cruel, Jeremy ?"" It was three months after this that Janey was sent for to go at once to the workhouse. Old Jeremy had lived there quite cheerfully and contentedly, but he had tailed very much ; old age and its infirmities seemed to be taking hold of him, at last. Janey found him in bed, vajy weak, very peaceful, the soul just to say flickering in its temple. A dreadful, dreadful pang shot through little Janey's heart. She who never doubted, doubted now. "" 0, Jeremy, Jeremy, was I right or wrong to get you to come here ?"" Jeremy smiled slightly. "" That's little Janey's voice,"" he said. Then gathering himself together, he answered her. "" You was always right, Janey. I hadn't meant to give in,"" he went on, "" but summat sorter seemed to fail me. Don't fret, Janey. Dost remember the crown o' thorns?"" He lifted his ami, and tried with one finger to draw a circle round his head, but his strength failed him. His arm fell to his side. "" T' Lord's taking me. That's t' little thorns, Janey. There ain't not even little ones up there, i' heaven. Are there, Janey ?"" "" No, no. It'll all be flowers wi'out thorns there. Do you remember the day you and I wont to the woods i' spring 1 We picked prim roses and vi'lets, and the birds sang to us. It was all quite still but for the birds. You said it would hey' been heaven if only you'd had a heaven i' you,, It's all heaven now."" So it was, for even as sho spoke the frail old body that had given Jeremy's soul so much soi row and trouble was tcnantless.— L.C., in Leeds Mercury.",Fiction

The Tiny Man found that he could not do as he liked with the showman, although he tried very hard. When he sulked lie got whipped. The showman made him. do a3 he was told in spite of all the little fellow's re bellion, and many times he wept bitterly when he thought of the pleasant home and easy times he had with Blue Shoes and her brother. Often he said to himself if he could run away he would, but he did not get the chance, for the showman watched him too closely. The monkey tormented him also at times, although he did not actually hurt him ; and, taking it altogether, the Tiny Man had some cause for discontent, for he had a great amount of dancing to do, and the weather was very hot. The showman travelled some miles every day, and found the Tiny Man a great attraction. The children were never tired of seeing him dance, although he was often very tired of danciDg, and the show man, not intending to be hard upon him, very often was sc ; for when the Tiny Man was overpowered with the heat, his master came to the conclusion that he was in a bad temper and would not listen to him. That is the disadvantage of having a disobliging, bad-tempered disposition. When occasions occur on which such individuals really have cause for vexation, it is always thought they "" are in one of their tempers,"" and no one sympathisers with them If, on the other hand, persons known to be gentle and sweet tempered are troubled or ill, a ready sympathy is expressed, because we know they are not in the habit of complaining without cause. The Tiny Man began to feel very ill, and said so, but the showman replied: ""Oh, no, yer don't 1 It's no use trying them tricks on me. You're getting lazy, that's what's the matter with you, my dear. And in vain the Tiny Man pleaded for a few days' rest. At last he was really ill, and when the showman saw it he was very sorry, and did all he could for him. He made a soft bed of hay inside a square, cool basket, and put the Tiny Man in it, and tended to him as best he could ; but the Tiny Man got worse instead of better, and one day he was so very ill that the showman thought he was dead. They were resting then beneath some trees on a river's bank, and the showman took the Tiny Man out of the basket and examined him. "" Dead as a door nail ! "" said he and threw him into the river, then got up and went on his way with the barrel organ and the mon key. When the Tiny Man fell into the water the shock revived him. He came out of his faint in a great fright. His eye&, ears, and mouth, were full of water, and he was too weak to shout ont or struggle much. However, in the excitement he gained a little strength and managed to scramble among some water cresses. On these he lay down and tried to find out how he came there, but it was no use he could remember nothing about it, so he gave it up and looked about for the show man. He was nowhere to be seen. "" Thank goodness 1 "" said the Tiny Man. "" I never want to hear a barrel organ again all my life. Grind, grind ; nearly into the grave."" Just then he heard a splashing of oars, and looking up saw a boat gliding gently along the stream. "" Who are those seated in the boat ? "" ex claimed the Tiny Man in a great state of ex citement. "" Blueshoes and her father and brother I "" Yes it was. Blueshoes in her pretty white frock, blue sash, and shoes, and the lame boy leaning back among the cushions, and their father rowing. The Tiny Man forgot how badly he had behaved, and in great excitement called out to them. At first they did not hear him and he thought they were going by when Blue shoes said : "" Papa, gather some water cress please,"" and the gentleman rowed the boat up, and leaning forward, tore up a great handful — upon which was the Tiny Man. There was a great state of excitement during the party. Blueshoes and the lame boy kissed him and the Tiny Man went down upon his knees and begged pardon. They forgave him and took him home, and he told them all his story and then he said to Willie : "" I have been very ill myself, and in my own pain have learnt to feel for others who suffer. If you will have me back I will, when I get strong again, do all I can when you are ill to cheer you."" . They - nursed him -tenderly till he was strong again, and then he proved by his altered behaviour how sorry he was for his previous 'ungrateful conduct. He made him self so pleasant"" and obliging that everyone thought it astonishing what a lot of pleasure could be given even by a Tiny Man. [The End.]",Fiction

CHAPTER XLL THE REGISTRAR OF THE MINISTER OF WAR- The 1 patriot left, but he had not rods far. Through the curtained window he watch over the turnkey to discover if he entered into conversation with any of the agents of the Republican policy one of the best that ever existed, one-half of the society closely watched the other, lees from the grertt glory oi government than for the still greater security of their heads. But nothing occiirred to excite the patriot's fears. At a few minutes before nine the turn kr-y rose, pinched the chin of the hos tess, and went out. The patriot rejoin ed him at the quay of. the conciergerie, fend they entered the prison together. On the same evening the affair ww con cluded, fend Father Richard accepted Murdoch as a substitute for Gracchus. Two hours before this arrangement took place, another scene had been enacted in a different part of the prison, which, although, apparently of no interest, wa« possessed of vital importance to the prin cipal personages o; this history. The registrar of (the conciergerie, fatigued with his day's labor, was folding up his papers, and preparing to leave, wb""n a tnan, conducted by the Gitoyenue Rich ard presented himself in his office. ""Citizen Registrar,"" said he, ""here is your fellow-registrar of the minister of war, who comes on the part ""Of the citizen minister to hasten some military mattere."" "" Ah,) citizen,"" said the registrar, ""you are ( too late ; I have just put away all my papers."" "" Dear brother, pardon me,"" said the newcomer ;• "" but we are really so over whelmed with business that even running docs not make up for lost momeutf, and our. lost moments are those occupied by others in eating and sleeping."" "" That alters the case, my dear fel low ;t so make haste, for, as you observe, it. is near supper time, and"" I am very hungry. Have you your document* ?"" "" Here they are,"" said/ the registrar of the minister of war, exhibiting a port folio of papers, which his brother, busy as. he was, scrutinized with the strictest attention.! "" Oh, they are all right."" said Rich ard's wife, "" and my husband has already thoroughly inspected them."" "" Never mind, never mind,"" said the registrar, continuing his examination. The registrar remained like a man patiently awaiting the accomplishment oh all due formalities. "" Perfectly cor rect,"" said the registrar of the con ciergerie, "" and you can now commence aa Boon as you please. Have you many entries to make ?"" "" A hundred. That will occupy you for several days. Therefore, dear brother, I wMh to form a small estab lishment near you; that is to say, if you will permit me."" "" How iam I to understand you ?"" tejaid the registrar of the conciergerie. "" Tl will explain it to you) fully if you will join ujs l at supper this evening. Tou Bay you are hungry %"" "" T do not deny ft."" "" Well, you shall see my wife, who Ib' a good housekeeper, and you know me for a good companion."" "" Ma foi ! yes/; you strike me as such, and my dear brother; yet, notwitlH Branding—"" "" Oh! come without ceremony, and partake, of eome oysters that I will pur chase as I pass La Place du Chatelet, a poulet, of our own roasting, and a few dishes which Madame Durand ex cels in."" "" You tempt me, my brother,"" said the registrar of the ponciergefrie, as tonished at the bill of fare, to which he was totally unaccustomed as a re gistrar paid by the Revolutionary Tribu nal at the rate of ten livres, in as signateu, equal to two francs, at the ut most. { "" Then you (will accept my invita tion ?"" ~ i , "" Yes, willingly."" ""In that case, to work to-morrow till this evening we part."" "" Now we must part."" "" You will come early ?"" ""In an instant, only I must first in form the gendarmes (who guard the iausitrian."" "" Why must you tell them ?"" ""So that when they knowi 1 am ab sent, and that there is no"" one at the wicket, they may become suspicious of every) noise."" "" Ah! that js a very wise precau tion,, faith!"" "" You understand now ?"" M Perfectly."" ""Go then."" OgL rft&MßJrar f& Jb« pr<j- appear in to-day's issue. eeededj hastily to the wicket, whiuh was opened by one of the gendarmes. "" Who is there ?"" ""I, the registrar, you know. f am goingi out. Bon Boir, Citizen Gracchus.' "" Boa soir, Citisen Kegistrar,"" and the wicketl was shut. The registrar of the minister of war had paid the gratest attention to this scene.j and while the door of the queen's prison' remained opened, his looks rapid- to the first compartment, where, seeing: the other gendarme. Du chesne, seated at (table, he felt per fectly assured the queen had only two guards, and when the registrar of the conciergeric turned round, his face had resumed its expression of perfect stolid indifference. As they went out of the conciergerie two toon entered. They were! the Citizen Gracchus and his couisn Murdoch. The cousin Murdoch nnd the registrar of the minister of war, each by a simultaneous movement arising from the eame feeling, appeared to shrink, the one at the sight of the hairy, bonnet, the other from the broad brimmed; hat pulled down over his eyes. *• Who are these men ?"" asked the re gistrar! of the minister of war. "" I only know one or them—it is a turnkey, named Gracchus."" ""Ah !"" said the other, with affected Jtidirrerence, ""do the turnkeys then go out of the conciergerie ?"" "" They have their day."" The investigation did not proceed any further, and the new friends took the road to the Pont au Change. At the cornerl of the Place du Chatelet, the re gistrary. of the minister of war, accord ing to agreement, (purchased somo oysters, and continued his way by the Quay de Greve. The dwelling of this individual Was simple. The Citizen Durand inhabited three rooms on La Placet de Greva, in a house; without any Jportcr. Each tenant haid a key of the doort In the passage, and it was agreed that if any one had omitted to take; his key, he should intimate the same by one, two or three rapa with thet knocker, according to the story ho in habited, and any one who was waiting and heard tha signal, then descended and Opened the door; but the Citizen Durand, having provided himself with his key, had not any occasion to knock. They ascended [two flights of stairs, when the Citissen Durand drew another key from his 'pocket, and they both entered. The registrar of tbe palace found his friend's wife much to his taste. She» was a charming woman ; indeed, an expression of profound melancholy dif fused over her countenance, stamped it with: an expression of deatp interest. It has always been allowed that sadness is Beductive in women, especially pretty women. It attracts all men, without exception, even turnkeys, and turnkeys are but men, after all, and what man possessed with natural (feeling would not' wish to console a pretty woman in affliction,? and as the Citizen Dorut re- white rose to a roseate hue !"" The two registrars did full justice to their excellent fcupper; it was only Mine. Durand who was eating nothing. In the meantime, conversation proceeded. The registrar inquired of his brother registrar? (with a curiosity the more re markable in these days, when such frightful (dramas were daily enacted) concerning the customs of Paris, the days of judgment and the means of lance.. The registrar of the palace, de lighted at being listened to with so much deference, replied with the great est complaisance, spoke of the manners of jailers, of Fouquier Tinville, and last- Iv of the Citoyen Sanson, the principal actor in the tragedy dally performed uponl the Place de la Revolution. Then, in hislturn, addressing his colleagues and host,/ he made various inquiries concern ing his vocation and ministry. "" Oh!"" said Durand, ""I am not so well informed as yourself, being a per son of much iloss importance, seeing that I am rather secretary to the re gistrar* than the incumbent of the pin ecu I do the work of the registrar-in-chiefi —an obscure employment for me, at least, but highly profitable to them ; but that is the way with all these revolutionary commissioners. Heaveni and earth may [perhaps change one) dav, but these things, never."" •*Well,»l will assist you, citizen."" sai'l the registrar of the palace, .charmed. with the excellenee of hi« host's win"", and. above all, with the beaux yens of Mme. Durand. ""Thanks."" fcaid he to whom this offer had been made; ""anything to vary the habits and locality in some distrac tion to a poor employe. T wish to hasten my work at the conciergerie, rather than to procrastinate it, and therefore thought if I might every cloy bring Madama Durand with me to the office, who is very dull here 1 —"" "" I do not nee any inconvenience in that,"" said the registrar of the palaeej, delighted fcvith the prospect of the charming* recreation afforded him by hie colleague.) ""She can (dictate the papere. said the Citizen Durand, ""and occasionally, when our work i.s finished, if you have not found this evening unpleasant, you can return, and spend"" an hour of two ■withe us."" "" Yes, but not too often,"" repliejd the registrar of the palace, foppishly ; "" for I declare I shall be scolded if my visists I declare I fcfeall be scolded if my visits house in La Rue du Petit Muse;."" "" Well r here is some one who will eet-t tl(/ all these affaire. Is it not so, chere! amie ?"" Mme. r Durand, pale and melancholy, aa usual, raised her eyes toward hre hus-: band, and replied: "" What you wish shall be done."" Eleven o'clock struck, announcing it was time to retire. The registrar of the palace rose, and took leave of his two friends, expressing the great plea sure he felt in making their acquaint ance. The Citizen Durand conducted hie friend to the landing, then res-entered the apartment. „ ~ . "" Go, Genevieve, go to bed, said he. The young woman made no reply, run. rose directly, took her lamp, and with drew to the (bedroom on the rigint.

My Papa knows you, and he says you're a man who makes reading for books ; But I never read nothing you wrote, nor did Papa — I know by his looks. So I guess you're like me when I talk, and I talk all the day, And they only say :"" Do stop that child ! "" or, "" Nurse ! take Miss Edith away."" But Papa said if I was good I could ask you — alone by myself — If you wouldn't write me a book like that little one up on the shelf. I don't mean the • pictures, of course; for to make them you've got to be smart ; But the reading that runs all around them, you know — just the easiest part. You needn't mind what it's about, for no one will see it but me And Jano— that's my nurse— and John — he's tho coachman — just only us three. You're to write of a bad little girl, that was wicked and bold and all that ; And then you're to write, if you please, some thing good — very good — of a cat ! This cat she was virtuous and meek, and kind to her parents, and mild, And careful and neat in her ways, though her mistress was such a bad child ; And hours she would sit and would gaze, when her mistress — that's me — was so bad, And blink, just as if she would say : "" Oh ! Edith, you make my heart sad."" And yet, you would scarcely believe it, that beauiful, angelic cat Was blamed by the servants for stealing what ever, they said, she'd get at. And when John drank my milk — don't you tell me ! I know just the way it was done — They said 'twas the ent — and she sitting and washing her face in the sun ! And then there was Dick, my canary. When I left its cage open, one clay, They all made me believe that she ate it, though I know that tho bird flew away. And why ? Just bpcause she was playing with a feather she found on the floor, As if cats couldn't play with feather without people thinking 'twas more. Why, once we wero romping together, when I knocked down a vase from the shelf, That cat was as grieved and distressed as if she had done it herself ; And she walked tiway sadly and hid herself, and never came out until tea — So they say, for they sent vie to bed, and she never came even to me. No matter whatever happened, it was laid at the door of that cat. Why, once, when I tore my apron — she was wrapped in it, and I called "" Rat ! ""—"" — Why, they blamed that on her. I shall never — no, not t,o my dying day 3Torget tho pained look that she gave me, when they slapped me and took me away, Of course, you know just what comes next when a child is as lovely as that. She wasted quite slowly away— it was goodness ■was killing the cat. I know it was nothing she ate, for her taste was exceedingly nice ; But they said she stole Bobby's ice cream, and caught a bad cold from the ice. And you'll promise to make me a book like that little one up on the shelf ? And you'll call her ""Naomi,"" because it's a name that she just gave herself; For she'd scratch at my door in the morning, and whenever I'd call out, ""Who's there?"" She would answer, "" Naomi ! Naomi ! "" like a Christian, I vow and declare. And you'll put me and her in a book. And, mind, you're to say I was bad ; And I might have been badder than that but for the example I had. And you'll say that she was a Maltese, and —what's that you asked ? "" Is ahe dead ? "" Why, please sir, there ain't any cat I You're to make one up out of your head !",Poetry

BY AMELIAIk EDWABD9, Author of ""Barbara’s History,” •‘Deben bam’a Vow,” &o. (Continued ,l To which Katchen and Brenda replied that the Herr Baron and Fraulein Winifred wished their engagement to be as private as possible ; that, in faot, the Herr Baron wes going back to England at the end of the week, _ It was strictly a family parly, and con sisted of relations only. There was the Pastor’s only brother, who kept a school at Weilheim, and there was Frau Kreutz mann’a three married sisters with their husbands and families ; to say nothing of half a dozen maiden aunts, besides nephews, niece?, and cousins innumerable. Most of these good folks were farmers from the neighborhood of Fartaukirohe and the Wal cheu-ee ; one or two were timber merchants ; but the most important personage of the family was a certain great uncle, who was a brewer and burgomaster of Starnberg. and who was reputed to be worth a hundred thousand florins. In short, there mnst have been nearly a hundred guests assem bled that evening under Pastor Kreutzmann’s roof. The Cider women, with scarcely an ex ception, wore gowns of rich black silk or satin, with sleeves puffed at the top and narrow at the wrists, little shawls of colored silk or Isce, and caps and aprons trimmed with old yellow blonde ; while two very old ladies, who came all the way from the borders of the Bavarian Forest, appeared ia turban-like head dresses of dark mole skin. One or two of the yonnger damsels who lived in the town and aspired to be fashionable were dressed in white mnslin trimmed with gay ribbons; but the rest, like K ateben and Brenda, wore the picturesque short skirt and embroidered cap which now only survives in rural districts, and like most national costumes is rapidly becoming a thing of the past. The gnests amused themselves after the manner of middle-class Germans in general and Bavarians in particular. That ia to say the elder men congregated in a room apart, smoking and beer drinking. The young people danced in the best parlor, which was cleared for the occasion; and the marriad women aat round and looked on. A couple of violins, two clarionets and a flute made excellent music in the passage outside, while every now and then between the waltzes a part song would be smug by four or eight voices, or some skilled performer would 4 oblige the company ’ with a solo ou the zither. A nation that dines at mid-day, goes to the theatre at fear, and comes home to sapper at eight, issnes its invitations naturally enough for evening parties at five. Fran Krentzmar.’a guests all arrived at the primitive hour. The business of the even ing was inaugurated with coffee, cakes, and beer ; dancing began a little before six ; and, because on Christmas Eve late hours were excusable, the supper was put off till ten, But the great event of the evening, after all, was Prau Krentzmann’s Christmas Tree— that Christmas Tree which for the last three days had been looked up in a room by itself, unseen by any eyes save those of Eatohen and Brenda, who were deputed to decorate it. This Christmas Tree was the good Frau’s invariable ‘ coup de theatre ’; and her guests knew perfectly well that it was to be forthcoming. Nevertheless, it was *de rigour ’ to affect entire ignorance of the im pending event. * We have a little surprise in store for yon, by and by,’ says Fran Kreutzmann, first to one and then to another, * Aha! you will see! Wait till half an hour before supper— you will see !’ Whereupon the nephew or cousin so addressed puts on a puzzled face, and pro fesses all the wonder proper to the occasion. In the meanwhile dancing went on apace, each waltz ending in Bavarian fashion with a thunderous stamp, sometimes aooompanied by a loud 4 Hah!’ in which all the performers united. The Herr Baron, having done his devoir by his host’s two nieces, retired from the field, and became a spectator for the rest of the evening. It may be that he found these solid Bavarian damsels more interesting from an artistic point of view than light in hand to dance with. * Does this amuse you ?’ he asked, stand ing beside Winifred’s chair. The couples were just pairing off for something like the eleventh waltz of the evening. 4 Very macb. They dance so well j and the music is charming-’ * Doesn’t it make yon wish to take a turn also?’ 4 I ?* she said, smiling. 4 1, who never learned to dance —who have never seen dancing till to night ? Yon forget what a barbarian I am.’ 4 Put it the other way, and say I forgot you were so highly civilised. What is dancing bat a survival cf barbarism —like tattooing or the wesring of earrings ? Nay, 1 mean It You should see how they waltz at some of these village festivals up in the mountain valleys.’ 4 It must be very picturesque.’ ‘Picturesque?—well, they spin round for hours together, like teetotums; and when they get tired of spinning they extemporise the most amazing variations on the original figure. Sometimes the women will gather in a knot in the centre, linking arms and stamping, while the men leap and slap their thighs ; sometimes the men go to the centre, while the women hop round on one leg! It is as wild a piece of savagery as any Maori war-dance. For my own part 1 believe that a'l these popnlar dances are cf remote an tiquity. The Albanian Greeks have a sword and musket danoe, which is undoubtedly a survival of the Pyrrhio dance. The Span ish Cachuoa came from Ancient Egypt, castanets and all. And as for the Nea politan Tarantel'a and Saltarello, you have but to come with me to morrow morning to the Ktrusoan vase-rooms at the old Pina cethek to see them depicted as they were danced in Latinm and Campania two thou sand years ago.’ * And that is what you call a survival of barbarism,* said Winifred, indignantly. 4 ts ow, to my thinking, it is we who are bar barians and degenerate. If I were an Albanian girl, how proud I should be to see my brother or my lover C ance that Pyrrhio dance I’ 4 Would you not rather go into a corner, and weep for the glory that had become a mere tradition ? Would you not ask. Where is the Pyrrhic Phalanx gone ? Give mo rather our Neapolitan Saltarello —a classic survival, if you like ; brit with nothing of fallen heroism about it.’ 4 What is it then ? What is it like ?’ 4 lt is a remnant of the old Bacchic jollities ; and the dunce, as I said a moment ago, is just like the wild group on the pointed vases—all wooing and projecting, flying and pursuing. There ia one figure in which the men pair off two and two, hook ing their left legs one in the other, and hopping back to back; their partners mean while beating their tambourines and spring ing into the air like wild Bacchantes.’ 4 I should like to see that!’ • I have seen it hundreds of times when I was a boy. We had a villa, yon know, at Castellamare, where we spent onr winters ; and whenever there was a popular fe»ta some half-a-dozen couples of young men and girls—our own boatmen and their sweet hearts generally—would come In costume, and dance for ns in the hall. It was a scene worth painting—my father and mother ■ tting apart, la two an‘ iiue carved chairs ; the s- r-ants peeping over the balustrades of the great staircase; four or five tall, bare footed fishermen In scarlet woollen ca, : s, standing round with lighted torches; and in the centre of the marble floor, the dancers whirling to the music of a couple of mando lines, How plainly I see It! How plainly I see the honse and all its surroundings— the loggia where my mother sat on sunny afternoons—the orange walk where Cnthbert used to carry mo to and fro, when I was a tiny little fellow—the old fashioned gar den, terrace below terrace, with bods laid out in heraldic patterns, where yon looked down upon the family coat of arms embla zoned in living flowers.’ *lt must have been a beautiful place, said Winifred. ‘ What has become of it ?’ * I have no idea. It was sold soon after my mother’s death, and I have never been near it since.’ ‘Would you mind taking me to see II some day, Lancelot?’ she asked, htsi tatingly, A troubled look came into his face. ‘I hardly know,’ he said, ‘ln one way it would be a sad sort of pleasure ; but — ’ ‘ But the pain would be greater than the pleasure. I ought to have known that—l ought not to have asked yon. Forget that I said it, Lancelot.’ Their talk had become so earnest that they forgot all ahont the waltzers and the scene before their eyes. Now, however, they became aware of a general movement in the direction of the door. It was half past nine o’clock, and the great event of the evening was about to come off. ' Dear Franlein Winifred,’ whispered Fran Krentmann, with a beaming countenance, * will hie Excellency the Herr Baron condescend to oome and see our Christmas tree ?' Chapter XLVIII. THE KEY OF THE BLUE CLOSET, It was a Christmas Tree to be prond cf. So every one said ; and so, with modest pride, Fran Erentzmaun told herself, when her guests stood round applauding. It rose ten feet above the tab in which it was planted—a well - grown, sturdy sapling, whose wide-spreading boughs were gay from top to bottom with ribbons and gifts, and lighted tapers. Never was seen a Chris tm a Tree so rich in pretty things. Here were presents suited to the needs and tastes of both sexes and all ages, each labelled with the name of the person for whom it waa destined— purses, piper, oigar-oases, needle cases, pencil - cares, pen - knives, work baskets, hymn - books, carved toys from Ober-Atnmergau ; staghorn brooches from the Black Forest; embroidered braces, slippers, and Bavarian caps; pen-holders, seals, paper-knives ; beer mags of painted porcelain and Bavarian glass; dolls and tops for such as had children at home; match-boxes, snuff-boxes, musical - boxes ; gloves, neckties, ribbons; and even such useful commonplaces as pocket - handker chiefs and stockings ! In short, there was not only a gift for every gnest, bat there were even gifts for many not actually pre sent. - • Great was the hsndoTapping, joyous were the exclamations, round ahont that Christ mas Tree. It was ‘ Schone! It was ‘ Wander - schone 1’ It was tTnerhort 1’ Where ever gifts so well chosen 1 How use ful 1 How pretty ! What a eaokful of florins it mast all have cost! Whose name is that on yonder silver spectacle ease 1 Pastor Erentzmann’s and from the Herr Baron, too—real silver, and engraved with a cypher 1 And those beautiful necklaces of amber and ivory, are they also from the Herr Baron, and do they bear the names of Katchen and Brenda 1 ‘ Ach Bimmel 1’ What it Is to have a mi-lord for one’s friend. And see !—that big Bible with the gilt clasp . . . that is also for the good Pastor, from his ni; ces. The ebony snuff box, inlaid with mother-of pearl, is for the great uncle—he who is brewer and burgo master at Starnberg. This powder flask ia for Bndolph Soherwin, who won the first prize at the shooting match last aatnmn ; Anachen Braun, who is going to be married, has a cuckoo clock ; and the two old ladies from the Bavarian Forest are provided with warm mittens and slippers for winter wear. Bat of ali the treasures that adorned that Christmas Tree there was not one that attracted fo much attention as a key that hnng on the very topmost twig, out of the reach of the tallest. It was a large, ordi nary looking key with a paper tied to the handle. What key waa it ? What would it open ? For whom waa it intended P These were questions that no one seemed able to answer. At last one youth bolder than the rest ventured to ask Krau Krentz mann for what purpose the key was placed there. Katchen and Brenda looked at each other and smiled. Frau Kreutzmann rubbed her hands and nodded mysteriously, ‘ The key ? So I —if anyone ia carious about the key,’ said she, * let him take it down and tee what is written on the label,’ Thus empowered, the youth fetched an alpenstock with a chamois horn tip, and hooked the key off in triumph. A dozen hands were immediately held up. ‘ Nein, nein * said he, *1 have taken it down, and I will be first to read it.* Still mounted on his chair, he unfolded the label, turned it this way and that, looked blank and tossed it to the nearest bystander. 4 Make what you can of it!’ said he. * It’s Oieek to me.’ • ‘ What is it ? Latin—French —English ?’ ‘ Let me look at it V •Ask uncle Erentzmann.’ ‘ I think It is in English—and that it is for Fraulein Winifred,’ said the Pastor, And so it was. A common iron key—not without a touch of rust on the handle—a key some three or four inches long, and addressed In Lancelot’s handwring, 'To Miss Savage, for what it may be worth.’ ‘For me I —""for what it may be worth !” What does it mean?’ she asked, confusedly; for all eyes were turned upon her. * I promised you a Christmas box,’ said Lancelot; 1 and here it is,’ ‘ But what am 1 to do with it 7 Does it open anything V ‘ It is the key of the Blue Closet.’ ‘The Blue Closet?’ • Which, unlike Bluebeard, I give yon leave to open.’ ' I am very grateful; but where is the Blue Closet, and what am I to do with your •ix headless wives when I have opened ItP’ ‘ They are yours to deal with as you may think fit. You can sketch them, model them, annihilate them, or bury them. You have but to find the door, turn the key, and take possession.’ Smiling and puzzled, Winifred looked from one to another. There was some play ful mystery here, and the Krentzmanns were in the secret. - ' Eatchen will tell me,’ she said. But Eatchen refused, and no one would enlighten her. She must search the castle, find the Blue Closet, and solve the riddle herself. Supper being announced, there was now a rush to the dining-room, where a mighty meal was provided. For though wont them selves to fare with primitive simplicity, the Ereutzmanns knew when and how to be profusely hospitable. At Christmas time especially, when the good pastor’s kinsfolk were met beneath his roof and the poor thronged about his door, it might with truth be said that— It snewed in hys house of meats and drinke. And now the feast was Homeric In its plenty, the appetites of the revellers wer no less herolo. Mountains of cold veal and sliced ' vorst ’ perished at the first on slaught ; Westphalia hams melted like snow before the sun; cakes of marvellous device vanished like the baseless fabric Of a vision ; and Bairische beer flowed as freely as methe gliu in the halls of Odin.

I saw her in the twilight, When the sun's declining beams Shone with a golden splendour, And gilded the woodland stream. She gazed on the glorious sunset With her sweet and sparkling eyes That far outshone in brightness The sheen of the starry skies. I watched her there enchanted, And my soul was strangley stirred, The desire of a life fast fading, . With the pain of my hopes deferred. The quest of my life was ended, She whom I sought was there, With the gleam of the sunset blending, With the gloss of her dark brown hair. In my dreams, this maiden has lured me, To many a far-off land, One loving glance of her starry eyes ■ Could lead me afar like a magic wand. I could hear in my .dreams her love song Wafted to me o’er the summer sea, Come on the wings of the Zephyr, Sighing low and sweet as a melody. There would my spirit wander In response to that song so sweet, There laughing receded the maiden, Gliding away with her fairy wand. And I like San talus vainly striving To grasp the golden fruit. Close at hand was my loved one shin ing, I heard her voice like a dulcet lute, But never one footstep nearer. The quest of my life would still retire, My soul buoyed up with the one fond hppe, Yet I felt how vain was my life's de sire. Then as I felt hope fading And, my heart in a dull despair; For hushed was the song of g!adn»ss That had lingered so fondly there. The stars were dark in my horoscope, My hopes were elusive now and • vain, Evanescent the once bright vision, I would dream the old dreams never again. Never more in the balmy starlight, When the moon’s pale beams are dieing, Would I list again to that dreaming voice Like a Zephyer softly sighing. Bat she came when ray soul was darkest, And stood in the sunset gleam, No longer an elusive vision, That is bom of an airy dream, But a sweet and radiant maiden To gladden my heart at last. Now was my wandering ended And my weary vision past. Glad as the wandering sea bird That flys to its sheltered nest, I had found one spring in the desert, And my soul would now have rest.

JSiB, — I never pass our old Burial Ground without a feeling, that, to allow it to remain as it is, is discreditable to the living, as it is disre spectful to the dead. The deserted Grave Yard is the Mausoleum of our early settlers, and a sacred spot,— one that (though we neglect it, to our shame if we do) it is to he expected will, in future times, be re garded with veneration, and guarded and pre served with scrupulous and pious care. Our posterity, coming to the inheritance of the-life rent estate, in a further stage of advancement, with difficulties fewer to encounter, and resources larger and better than we enjoy, borne to them in a great measure as the ripened fruit of our planting, will, it is to be hoped, in this, as in . other ways, manifest a patriotic and deferential respect to the virtues of perseverance, energy, and .principle which distinguished the founders of Otago — characteristics which they really bore in it' degree that contrasts : favourably with the ' - generality of the -emigrant originators of young { settlements. . We. are warranted in concluding this from what, is. taking place in Europe. Civilization is advancing, — and as it. advances, not only is the evidence ■"" of purer- and more refined sentiments and feelings becomings more common, but the genius of Christianity, is developing it self in fairer aspects, and pervading our evervrday acts, and adopting, as modes of teaching and impressing the heart, not so much the horrors of death and punishment, as the graces and rewards which; the pleasant paths of religion and virtue present. And in nothing, and nowhere: is it more evident than, ""in the depositories of the dead, — in the Cemeteries and Necropolises that abound. In these the death-heads and cross-bones of a ruder age are fast disappearing, and the finest genius of this land is engaged upon sculptured monu ments, erected over the graves of departed friends, .hearing epitaphs at once suggestive, affectionate, and instructive ; tending to soothe the bleeding hearts of monmers, and awaken to reflection the thoughtless many ; while tasteful arrangements are being givento the grounds, walks kept in re pair, flowerbeds, attended to, and the wholeyen 4ored spots which aye frequently and freely re sorted to' under hallowed .iundjjacred influehefes. 2x'o doubt this* cpirifc will, if. not vow, in time, reach here; -and our ancestry will preserve the old cemetery 'with (pare; and .attention, and in a numncfr graceful and appropriate, r ■ But why should we fectvfi the work to them ? We knew personally that' Ijttle 'band, so' many, of , whont 4 thjgfe^epose.' "" They were* our relations andj; ?jn£inrates— they -are"" enshrined in ■ our . njemories,—^and it is rartainly our special busi-"" .td'Vta&e in chafge^the beautifying of their ~|ut <<e»t»g-^lace. i'MaA-ne would hear to the generation following a ""belter character if we do so : if we give it in descent to them, such as it ought to be, rather than as it is,r~ a mess of weeds and broken down mementos. It would neither be difficult nor expensive to do all that is required ; although expense should not, in such a case, be a matter of serious con sideration. Let walks be formed, gravelled, and kept in repair ; let flower-beds be planted, and a few trees, — weeping willows and Norfo'k Island pines if they could be successfully grown ; or, failing them, blue gums and kios. Private par ties would surely also attend to the repairing of the several repositories of the ashes of their friends. The Town Board might very appropri ately vote a sum for such a purpose. Indeed I should say if they do not, they will be making it clear that they ai*e not keeping pace with the refined and civilizing tendencies of .the age, and giving additional cause for its being said, as it has often been, that the tendency of colonization is rather to retrogression than advancement. It is very clear, from the revelations of history and the observation of travellers, that where there is little respect paid to the memory of the departed, there is a deficiency in the practice of the higher virtues bearing on the intercourse of the living, — little of the devotion of love, — and but a scanty display of even the amenities of friendship. I trust no excursionist in Otago will erer have to jot such a remark in his note-book, founded on what he has observed. A Dunedinite. To the Editor of the Or ago Witness. Sir, — You would much oblige me by inserting the following in your valuable paper, tor the in form.ttion of the community at large, and to expose the gross injustice toi which I have been subjected : — A short time ago, I had the^ misfortune to be put in gaol for a small debt which I was unable to pay. For the first 13 da)s of my confinement, 1 was locked up either in a cell 6 feet by 2, or in a passage 21 leelby 3|, along with the unconvicted prisoneis, and during that time I was let out only 2 hours in the forenoon and 2 in the afternoon, and 1 believe J should have been kept thc-ie for the whole of my term, but for another unfortunate like inj self being in the same perdicament, who, being a good scholar, was employed by the Gaoler to keep his books and write his letters, and as it was rather too glaring an absurdity to set him free and keep me confined, I was accordingly liberated also ; and, during the time that he was in the place, I had the privilege of rambling about the building from 6 in the morning till 7 at night. But, unfortunately for me, his lime too soon came to an end. And now comes -the joke; — how was the Gaoler to get me back to my old bondage ? Hut "" where there's a will there's a way;"" and the Gaoler soon found the way, though I daresay had he given it more thought he would not have tried such an expensive mode, in la - ing himself open to the law, by exceeding his duty towdtds debtors. The way it happened was this, — the butcher sent down two days' allowance of meat as usual ; the meat was so bad (in fact, crawling with maggots), that the hard labour men knocked off work, and refused lo eat it, — of course I also re fused to eat it, — in consequence of which the hard labour men wee all locked up in their cells for 48 hours on bread and water, and I myself sinned the same fate with them, all because I refused to swallow meat which was unfit tor human food. I should like to he informed by what law a man is compelled tomcat thai which he does not like, or by -what law it is held a crime to refuse to do so ? I presume it to be the Gaoler's duty to inspect all provisions, and to send back to the contiHclois such as are unfit for use. The quesiion is, has the Gaoler acted as his office demands ? and are the authoiities justified in retaining an officer who fails in his duty, and who, by ihc above mentioned piece of petty tyranny, has cost the Government 14 full days of labour, which might have been avoided had he done his duty by sending back the had meat, and obtaining good merft in its place 1 Indeed, did I not know -the Gaoler lo be an honest man, I should ceitainly suspect that theie'wasan understanding between him and ihe butcher. Is it not a wonder that such things are allowed to exist in a Christian community like Otago? I hope, Sir, that this will meet the eyes of those who hnv,p the power to lemedy the evil, and the will to see justice done to the oppressed. "" Fiat justitia ruat coelum."" Youis, &c, A LATE Dr.BTOR, [We have to inform our correspondent, and others who like him have complaints to make against (he gaoler or other official, that there are certain Justices of the Pence who are appointed to visit the gaol, and hear any such complaints ns that now made.

He desires one moment to pose as the champion of the Mining Act, demurring at the fact of its labour clauses being openly defied and set at naught; and at another (the present) moment we find him the champion of those very per sons who are breaking down the labour clauses of the Act with one man and a boy; and he tells us—as if in extenuation of bis sudden change of front—that the Mining Act is sub ject to the discretionary power of the Wardens who administer it, and hence it is that the conditions of the said Act are not rigidly adhered to. This does not say much for the Wardens’ re spect for the laws of the country which gave them their official positions, but “ Pennyweight ” has either purposely put it in this light to mislead the general public, or, through sheer ignorance, does not know the interpre tation of discretionary power, as in tended by the Act. lam inclined to the latter belief, and I will therefore tell him that discretionary power is only to be exercised by a Warden in technical cases, or when some very nice ppint of law is raised by the con tending parties, and even then discre tionary power has a time limit; but there can be no discretionary p jwer as to. whether the required number of men should or should not be employed on a thirty-acre claim, otherwise there would be no need for an Act at all. As to “ Pennyweight’s ” absurd refer ence to the shareholders being con sulted on this section of the Act, if it rested with them to use their discre tionary power as to the number of men to be employed there would be, in that case, no need of a Warden. Further, the two companies which 1 individual ised in my last letter have long since passed the embryotic state, though “Pennyweight” would endeavour to make .the public believe that these claims are still in embryo, and that he is satisfied with the operations being carried on, as if he (“ Pennyweight ”) was the ruling power. Who the—l was going to use a strong adjective here, but I know that you would not print it; so I will content myself by asking, Who is “ Pennyweight,” to thus set himself up to the level of a Warden ? He tells us that he has in his mind’s eye the old adage, “ Fools rush in where angels fear to tread.” I certainly think it advisable for him to keep that adage in his mind’s eye always, and not rush in again, for we are surfeited with pennyweights, and sicken at the bare mention of the word. To conclude his scribble, “Penny weight ” adds that 1 have a personal animus to display in this correspond ence. Now, Sir, he has no right whatever, under a nom de plume, to throw such a charge, hint, or in nuendo, unless he is wall prepared to prove it, and, even then, it would be more manly to come forward and sign his own name, as I have done, but whether he is man enough to do so, or not, 1 will now tell him that so long as 1 have a hand to hold a pen and a head to guide it, 1 will ever expose those who evade and defy the Mining Act, Yours, &c„ T.

In tbe darkness of the first hour after midnight a man strode down an unfre quented city street toward the river. There was no moon and the stars shone dimly. The place he had chosen was remote from tbe life of tbe town and well sotted to his purpose. Tbe street ended in a steep declivity. Adjoining the wooden pier whicb stretched oat into the water were some giant rock?. On the ledge of one of these the man sat down and waited. For what he could hardly have told, This was the last boor of his life, and be went over in rapid retrospect the mis spent days that bad preceded the end now 60 close at band. The only son of parents who bad idolised bim, he bad had every advantage. A collegiate edu ottioo, inherited wealth, tbe benefits of travel and tbe society of culture people —all these had been his. He had mar ried early in life a woman who had wor shipped him, and was now dead — for this he breathed a prayer of ness—- and his future bad been full of promise. . . . Then bad come the last years— the wasteful extravagance, tbe reckless living and finally dishonor able failure. There was but one thing left for a man who had so wreckod his career. He rose and looked out at tbe water which was so soon to close over his throbbing bead. As he stood io the shadow of tbe rock he brard a stealthy footstep approaching. A woman crept gist him aud walked out upon tbe pier. er face he could not see, but the figure, dimly outlined in the darkness, was slight and youthful. The maD watched her curiously as she advanced almost to the end of the pier, where she paused irresolutely. She stood thus for some time and at length threw off ber wrap and again started forward. Moved by a sadden impulse, the man walked softly but rapidly until be atood almost at tbe woman's elbow. 'Are }ou afraid T be then BBked. The woman sttrted and smothered a crj. She turned a terrified foca toward the man, and in the faint starlight be taw that she was beautiful. 'Do tot fear me,' he said; 'I am not here to binder you.' 'Who are yoo?' she whispered, sbrink ieg back Against the rail— '* by have you fot lowed me 7' 'I have not fullowtd you; I am a miserable creature such as I suppose you to be,' be said bitterly. 'I am here on the same errand.' The woman seemed to breathe mor freely, and drawing a little nearer sh looked curiously at the man. 'You mean that you, too, w»nt to — to end everything.' 'Yet, like you— but you drew back,' 'I was afraid,' she murmured; 'the water looked so black and cold. It will be easier when the sun rises and the , river is all rippling and sparkling — oh, [how beautiful and inviting it is then 1' 'Let us go together,' be said, holding out his hand; 'then you may not dread it so much.' 'No.no, 1 and the woman again shrank away from him. Bhe was shivering now B 3 with a nervous chill.

She almost clung to her companion as he assisted her from the pier >o the rock. Here they sat together in eilence for some time. Occasionally the woman glanced wouderingly at the man who had led her away from the presence of death. At length ho began speaking softly, almost to himself. The woman listened eagerly when she found that he was telling bis own btory, and that Bhe was to know what brought him to the river's brink where they had met. When he had finished, she asked him with a touch of ecora in her voice : 'And that is all I—for1 — for that you would leap oat yonder ?

Bib— -So, Mr Hudson thinks it 1b a disgrace to parents not to send the oommittte more (illegal) money. Well, it can only be assumed that the parentß are not all so well oif as Mr Hudson, and that he regards poverty as a crime. It would be very interesting to know, as Mr Hudson has bad all his children taught at the State School, how much he has given duriug these many years. He is certainly such a model Chairman tbat lie might enlighten the public as to that point, and also explain how this mouey is spent- One thing is certain, Mr Hudson knows exactly where specifications may be seen, namely at the Cleveland Hotel, of which Mr Hudson is a proprietor. It is to be hoped that he finds it profitable ! Mr Altken's modesty is evidently reserved for Sundays. No doubt on those holy dayß he is the perfect man, a good, pious, meek and professing Christian, with his big soul overflowing with charity towards his fellow creatures, and praying loud and long. A discerning' public, however, demands tbat pious professors, with gilt-edged books on Sundays, should likewise appear through out the week in a similar character, if not in outward visible signs, still with a degree of Christian grace calculated to stamp the genuine professor and adorn his every action, at the same time distinguishing him from the hypocrite. If a man is to be judged by his deeds, and the public read between the lines ot Mr Aitken's dastardly and venomous attack on Mr Gammell. they can arrive j at no other conclusion than that Mr A.itken displays the most intemperate dls» regard of the many Christian virtues, which he parades before the world on the holy Sabbath. In fact, bis charges against Mr Gammell are of a cowardly and contemptible character, and deserve the censure of every right thinking person ia the community, who cannot but regard his bitterness as arising out of some disappointment in which personal gain is involved. Who is this Mr Ait ben who is going to put everybody right and act the part of general censor in such an undisguised bitterness of feeling ? He, no doubt, is a paragon of excellence, according to Mr Aitken's analysis of Mr Aitken* The public have also the opootaole of Mr Jack and Mr Hudson criticising the acts if the Board of Education, of which they themselves are members. On the Board, most docile aDimals, off the Board most traitorous, a proud position certainly to ocoupy and another strong proof of their insincerity, and the danger of gentlemen, such aa these, holding a dual position in educational matters. Mr Jack and Mr laudson are so well known for their inconsistency, that the general reader need not express surprise. A long residence here, certainly, has shown up their good qualities, but has not omitted to expose their bad ones, also. A vast amount of self esteem and selfishness at any rate predominates. Adopting Mr Aitken's virulent adjec tive. I am, &c, Dastabdly. As the constant dropping of water will wear away the hardest atone, so do the various processes of life wear out the physical organism ; every motion of a finger, every breathinhaled, every thought conceived, and every word spoken causes destruction of some of the complex mole cules which together form the hnman system. This results in formation of a quantity of effete matter called ' waste products,' which if retained in the system give rise to various diseases ; if retained in the muscular tissue they cause rheu matism, gout, &c. ; in the lungs, con sumption, in the blood — skin diseases, boils, pimples, blotches, and kidney diseases. The blood is purified and im purities expelled by the various processes of excretion — respiration, perspiration, micturation, and defecation. Where these functions are not properly performed such symptoms as headache, nervousness, pal pitation, vomiting, diarrhoea, toothache, neuralgia, and constipation are frequent, and must have immediate treatment or serious disease will undoubtedly set in, if the first symptoms are attacked a cure is easy — if neglected a cure is sometimes Impossible. It Clements Tonic is faith fully used quick relief is assured. This medicine quickly restores the normal action to any weakened or impaired organ; it purifies and strengthens the blood, stimulates the kidneys and liver, and relieves the bowels of all impactions of faecal matter and strengthens the nervous system generally. It's value is proved by the evidence of its patrons. F. M . Vernon, Esq., Tumut, (N.S.W.) writes ua :—'l: — 'I cannot speak too highly of Clements Tonic. In a case of extreme nervous exhaustion which came nnder my personal observation, the effects were truly marvellous. Two bottles worked a radical cure. I have n-xed numerous instances wsre it has bad a most beneficial effect in impaired constitutions.' Mrs Emily Webb, 203 Rose-street, Darlington, (N.S.W.) writes us :— * I desire to notify the very beneficial influence • Clements Tonic has had upon my general health. I was suffering from acute neuralgia, and a troublesome numbness and loss of power of the right arm. I was induced to use Clements Tonic which completely cured me, aud restored my strength and appetite, which I had lost for the last 16 months, and all with only 3 bottles ' Miss A. M. Vincent, Springvale, Wagga Wagga, writes : ' Kindly send me two bottles of Clements Tonic. I have never taken anything to equal it for indigestion, and nervousness. For years I have beun suffering and have tried doctors' treat ment, but none ever had the curative effects of Clements Tonic. I ha ye strongly recommended it to my friends and one lady says she willnever be withont it.' Nota Bene. — You must get Clements Tonic. Kemembar there are men who would sacrifice your health and miybe your life for the sake of a shilling profit, therefore if any retailer tries to sell you any other make, he is only trying to im pose upon the trust you place in him, for if he had an article to equal Clements Tonic he would not want to sell it you, because it would cost him double the retail price of the genuine to make, more over, they cannot make it as they cannot get the material. Shun such men, for ever more, as you would the plague. They have been trying to burst up the water famine at Broken Hill by bringing the rain-making theory to bear upon the Bubject. And the various articles re quired to effectively dissolve the elements make an appaling catalogue. It was proposed to send up twelve ballons filled with dynamite, rack-a-rock and gun cotton — the first named explosive to drive downwards, the second upwards, and the third outwards. And, in addition to these, shells are to be sent up with a mortar. If all this dosen't bring a water spout down upon Broken Hill it won't be for want of trying. But we fear it will sufier the fate of a little town in America where a drought had prevailed for some time. Then the rain producer came along. He exploded ballons, harassed the pure ether with self bursting shells, and disintegrated the fleecy clouds with sky rockets. For a day or two nothing eventuated. Then the Heavens opened, and it rained for forty days and forty nights. There was an aquatic carnival on in no time, and the inhabitants all took to swimming. The wateirs rose until there wasn't any more town . And now there's a new lake on tha.t map.",LetterToEditor

Ivevv joys denied, the old oacs passed away We still look forward to the coming day. Ihc little bird just newly from the nest Looks forwai-d daily, to its ov'ning rest; The little maid, the curly -headed boy, \* ith hope look forward to each promised toy. I well remember all my early days, My childish iirpulsc and my sportive ways. When guile had hardly ringed my boyish mind, When i was free and joyous as the wind. I roamed around through every shady nook And fished for minnows in the purling brook. Hope then began to throb within my breast, And made me feel more eager in my quest To hook the minnow in the limpid pool, To play the truant and avoid the school. My shadow seem'd the brooklet to affright, u'he minnow sulkily refused t>i bite. Then in the woods, with schoolmates blithe and gay, I lOJiped and played from dawn till close of day In squirrel hunting. Oh! I see it now, The squirrel always gained the topmost bough, And there clung on in sunshine and in rain ; To bring him down wo tried, but tried in vain. He blinked upon us with his glittering eyes, And now I think the little fellow wise. His niita he cracked, aor heed stick nor stone, Till disappointed urchins all were goae. So time wears on and will wear on again Till those who once were boys grow boarded men, And with life's ever ebbing flowing tide Are scattered o'er the ocean far and wide. In manhood's vigour all tlie world they dare To meet with disappointment or despair. To roam the earth to join in bloody strife. To meet an early grave. Ah! such is life! Yet some succeed by accident or stealth And hoard up vast accumulated wealth. On those "" Damo Fortune"" lavish g-iftß bestows And ev'ry breeze brings fortune as it blows. More gold they crave, to gather ie they press And deem each lucky coup a new caress. For them the world prepares a smiling1 face Because they're foremost in the money race, TiJl one grim fellow comes amid the gloom, A scythe his weapon and his gift the tomb. For him bright"", gold had never any charms, He grasps the victim in his leaden arms, And calmly waiting for the final gasp, Enfolds him in his cold and clayey clasp. In vain the tears of child, of loving wife : }lis hour has come at last. Ah! such is life! fieref t, alone, why should they long repine, But humbly but unto the will diviue. Death is the fate of ev'ry mortal man. Norm can outreach his due appointed span; Yet whilst we're here let none turn deaf and flee From claims of wretched poor humanity; Lot none upon his hoarded wealth set store Nor drive the famished beggar from his door ; Srab not his neighbour with the slanderer's knife ; Then may wo fill enjoy a better life. Tho rich msy revel in their wealth to-day. To-morrow comes and snatches them away. Hope be our watchword for the coming years Till golden sunshine wipes away all tears. TimDoolaw.

As soon a* one of them accept* the proporal made, a cable meeeeg* i* deepatched to the shipper or seller, advising the sale of toe good*. Bow, cable message* between Europe and distant parte of the world are baaed upon very ctriet and clearly printed rake, and forma of contract, agreed upon in writing be* forehand; then can, therefore, be no mis nndentanding between the agent in Europe and tbe thipper in distant parte i but it i* not to between the agent and hie buyers, among whom, many find out email quibhlea the next day on receipt of the contract if the market hae gone lower, consequently, die* agreements occur, and eometimee n tale, which the agent considered at perfectly in order, mid which he bad advised a* each to hie teller, fell* through quite unexpectedly, and, humanly speaking, through circumstances which he had not loreeatn, and for which ho is very little, if at ail, to blame. Bow, if on any each event happening, he were to telegraph to the seller that the basi neie which he had advised the pnriomi day, or sometime* two or three days before (because a dispute last* to long until it it clear that tbe agent It, what we call, lurched with the goods), the shipper would simply reply, "" Oh! we only know you, that is quite sufficient. We have nothing to do with the dispute* between yon and your buyer."" Con* eeqnently, the agent does not even attempt to go back upon hie teller, but he bean the brunt of the cate, and usually telle the goods with a lose, because it most not be forgotten that these things happen almost exclusively in a Idling market, and that boyars pats over many small points during a rise, whereat they make objections at everything during it do* dine. We do not mean to say that this is universally the case, bat unfortunately, with tbe present keen competition, the agent cannot always select his buyers to a nicety, and some of them are very difficult to manege, and the contract is not really a binding document until the buyer's tig nature has been affixed to it If shippers would consent to re-aesume the position, of owners, and to cancel sales advised when the agent had found some on* expected bitch, it would be very much to the advantage of the latter, because the occasion* where, under each circumstance*, the ageat telle afterward* with aa extra profit, era so lew and far between that they need soft be taken into account Through the kindness of a gentleman con* netted with Bew Zealand, we have been allowed to tee the lessee of year paper of Jan.

Is several of these it ie assumed that the agent, when lurched with stuff, askes afterwards a profit, but this is quite a mistaken view, as we have already explained. We quite agree, however, that when thipper* or farmer* tend their geode forward oa ooaeigemeßt, to be die posed of by the consignee, entirely at the owners' or shippen* risk and expease the latent art entitled to have produced to them, when required, all the original account* of expense* and disbursements, and, a* far a* we are personally concerned, we shall, under such oiroamstanoee, be always moet happy to hold our book* at the disposal of anyone doty qualified to inspect them; for we do not think that a eommlwion agent is entitled to any profit whatever, over ami above the commiseion that ha* been agreed upon between hie principal and himself. W* do not think, however, that to much straw should he laid on the ease of an agent who having had, through such circumstance* as explained above, to take upon his own shoulders goods in a falling market, and, having kept them for a certain time at hie own risk and peril, makes aa extra profit afterward*. We, of eourae, do aol msan thereby to sanction—and, indeed, we repudiate in the meet unequivocal way—the principle of a consignee, or agent, becoming, through some underhand manoeuvre, toe owner of th* good* entrusted lo him for salt, because he foresee* aa improvement io llw market, and thinks that he would rather have the future profits than leave them to hie client.

It dazzled the eyes of the old coastguardsman as he looked out upon the sea, bringing his telescope to bear upon what seemed to the naked eye but a speck upon the waves; but his eyes, old man though he was, were sharp and keen through long years of practice, and, evidently having satisfied his curiosity, he lowered his instrument.

Very young she ap peared to be thiukmg of mirriage so soon, for she did not lojk more than suteen, and her diminutive figure added to her childlike appearance. Vouchsafing no reply to this badinage, but with a look half shy, half pleased at the old man, she threw oyer her head the crimson handkerchief wbich had been hanging over her shoulder, and darted along the path leading to the foot of the mountain. ' She doesn't look much like a fisherman's wife,' muttered the coastguardsman as he turned again to his telescope. Not like a fisherman's wife ! And yet she was skimming like a bird, barefooted, over the stony path, her peasant's dress flying behind her, and her suuburnt face radiant with joy, to meet her fisherman lover as soon as Ins feet should touch the shore. Yes, and she could lend a t-kilful hand to haul in the nets, and cjulJ manage a boat as well as David himself; she had been out in more than oue storm so terrific that her lover's cheek hud grown pale at the thought o$ her dauger, and the brave girl had not uttered oue cry of fear. But, for all this, old Evans was right j and the same thought had often crossed the mind of David Tregithiau also, causing a feeling half of loving pride, half of regret —for there was in Meg, in spite of her peasant's costume and surroundings, a fairy-like grace and refinement which formed a marked contrast to the manner of her companions and associates. 1 Little Meg' she was cslled by every one, and h»r very diminutiveuess was a charm. For hers was not a stunted growth—she was delicately and exquisitely proportioned, and her hands and her feet, though brown as berries, were small aud dainty. It was well that she looked with disdain upon such in cumbrances as boots, for no shoemaker in the village could hive fashioned his coarse materials into such marvels of neatness as would have suited her. With the nimblest feet and the lightest hands, she had also the sweetest face in Tredgar. The beantiful con tour of her cheeks, with the soft colour glow ing through the clear brown, the delicately* shaped nose, mouih, aud chin, but for the brownncss might have belonged to the most aristocratic maiden in England Too delicate, too r.'fined a face it wis, gome thought, to be exposed to the wia <s and storms and hardships of a fisher's life. Amongst those who thought this wa9 Captain Frank Hayes, of Tredgar Castle, whose piety in >ittending church so devoutly for six consecutive Sundays had been noticed with approval by his aunt, Lady Tredgar, until this feeling hid changed into the strongest disapprobation upon finding that h's prayer-book remained open at tiie same place throughout the whole of tho service, while his eyes were fixed in evident ad miration upon the sweet face of Meg Trejmhian. The grand lady could not but admit to herself, in spite of her displeasure, that it was an exquisite face. 'Tnekindof face which reminds one of a wild rose, my dear,' she said on her way home to her niece, Captain Frank's sister, who happened unfor tunately to be plain. As Meg rau down the mountain that even ing, a sharp turn in the path br.Ujht her un expectedly face to face with two gentlemen, one of whom, to her slight embarrassment, she recognised as Captain Hayes j the other was a much older man, and, even in her in experienced judgment, much less a gentleman in appearance. Tfcp officer looked significantly at bis oom* panion, and muttered quickly a short senten. in French. Meg was obliged fo stop short for the path wis narrow, and thi> gentlemen made no attempt to let her pass. She had noticed the significant look, anr' had heard the quickly xpoken sentence; and 'ier cheeks flu-hed as she drew back her l oid with a pretty look of childish displeasure. ' Will you let me pass, sirs ?' she said, in a low voice, still with her head r>isrd, and her eyelids slightly lowered, with all the hauteur which a Belgravian belie might have thrown into her tone and manner. ' Question her/ said Captain Hiyes, still in French, and in an undertone, to hi* com panion j his first words had been, ' This is the girl.' The elderly man obeyed. ' Pardon me, young lady,' he began, in i smooth, blsnd voice, which had in its tone evei a suspicion of deference—' it is not merel; faom motives of curiosity that I ask—will yoi favour me with your name ?' ' Margaret Tregithian, sir,' she replied giving an anxious glance towards the boat which was drawing very near the shore. 1 Are you David Tregithian's sister ?' I Mo sir, we are not relations.' This cinn her head drooped and she blushed painfully. 'Then—pardon me again —how is it thai you call yourself Tregithian ?' ' David's parents adopted ne. Fathei Tregithian found me iu his boat one morning when I was a biby.' She moved impatiently The boat had touched the shore, and she could feel that Captain Hayes's eyes were fixed upon her. He was the next to speak. Meg had seer him often, but this was the first time she had ever heard his voice,l and at the first sound she raised her eyes involuntarily to his face. It was very handsome, and his voice was refined and pleasant. His smile, too, was win ning, and she responded to it in spite of her self. He had thought her pretty before, but how charming she looked now, with that half reluctant smile upon her lips ! ' I hope you do not think us impertinent, though I am afraid these questions must appear so to you. This gentleman, Mr Burnet, is a lawyer, and he has sought the in* formation which you have so kindly given us in the interest of a client.' The latter part of this speech was wholly inexplicable to Meg, but she understood from the tone that it was intended to be apologetic, and answered, simply, with a step forward as if to pass them— ' Don't mention it, sir.' 'lt will very soon be dark,' continued Captain Hayes; ' are you not afraid to go down this lonely path alone ?' 'Oh dear, no!' was the quick reply, with an uneasy look towards the two gentlemen, for they had turned round as if with the intention of walking back with her. 1 1 like better to be alone,' she added, and quickened her pace, while her cheeks flushed with annoyance, What would David say to her walking by the side of these two gentlemen ? Besides, it could not look well in the eyes of any one for a poor girl like her to be seen in such high company. ' Then you will not allow us to have the pleasure of escorting you to the aottom ?' The poor child knew not what reply to make, she was so afraid of appearing rude in return for such gracious condescension. 4 1 shall go quicker by myself, if you please,' she stammered. So, with a courteons "" Good evening,"" they allowed her to pass swiftly before them while they sauntered slowly after. As the fluttering end of the crimson handkerchief disappeared round a jutting rock, Captain Hayes tossed away the end of the cigar he had bt en smoking, and, clapping his haud on the shoulder of his grave-looking companion, ex claimed with enthusiasm— 'lsn't she a little gem, Burnet? And what a lucky thing it is that I have never spoken to her before to day, for, by Jove! I've been uncommonly near doing it once or twice. If I had done so, I must have made love to the little beauty, and that would have told against me under the present circum stances, you see—made things awkward, wouldn't it P' They could see, from the point they had by this time rerched, the figure of little Meg tripping along the gauds towards the boat. The lawyer, without enswerinp his com panion's speech, direoted his attention to the spot, and, as if unking the remark to himself said— ' This intended marriage with the fisher* man is rather an awkward feature in the case.' A cloud passed over the hitherto gay 03un* tenance of Captain Hayes, as he replied lightly— ' Ah, yes, it will be rather hard on the poor beggar, but I dare say he wou't prove incon solable—money is a wonderful panacea for all the woes of that sort of people.' No more was said by either, until they found themselves at the bottom of St. Mary's Head ani following the white, dusky road which led to Tredgar Castle. Here they were met by two figures, those of a young man and a girl j the former was tall, upright, and powerfully built, the latter scarcely tall enouoh to reach his arm, to which, however, she cluug with a caressing air of confidence that told its own tale It was getting dark, but there was still light enough for the two gentlemen to reoognise ' little Meg.' David Tregithian tou ;hed his hat respectfully to the young Captain, who was well known among the fishermen, and who was about to pass on, but, unable to resist the temptation of ex changing another word or two with Meg, whose head was turned bashfully towards the sea, Captain Hayes said, pleasantly— ' You have far outstripped us, you see—we have ouly just reached here.' She dfd not answer, not kaowing quite what to say, but she turned to the speaker with a very pretty smile, which pleased him almost as much, though the next moment she glanoed shyly at her lover, who did not look quite at case. < Good evening 5 I hope I may soon have the pleasure of seeing you again,' and the Oaptaiu's eyes rested for a moment with an admiring expression on the blushing face. ' Good niijht, Tregithian,' he aided, in quite a different tone, to the young fi-her nan—so different that it was almost contemptuous in its lightness. The parting words to Meg had been spoken respectfully enough, aud with no undue familiarity in the tone, yet; David Tregithian felt insulted. What right had Captain Hayes of Tredgar Castle to express a wish tc see his Meg—almost liis wife—again ? He drew the small figure closer to his sid6 and tightened the clasp of his arm round her pro* teotingly. ♦ My little Meg,' he said in a voice so kind and gentle that it seemed hardly to belong to the rough, muscular young fisherman, ' how is it that the Captain speaks to jou ?' Yet, though his voice wag so calm, if Meg could have seen his face—which she could not, fer her head was hidden againso his rough jersey—she would hare discerned that, it was troubled, nay, almost stern in expre sion. She told him, without the slightest reserve or affectation, the story ot their meeting on the mountain path, and of the questions which the lawyer had put to her; still hu brow did not clear.

A cold, grey, drizzly morning, with a keen wind blowing, making one turn with a sigh of satisfaction from a view of the mist-enveloped hills to the cosy little room with its bright fire and daintily appointed breakfast-table. Gamo pie, plover's eggs, crisp brown toast, snowy scones, and golden honey and marmalade in crystal dishes, form an inviting array of eatables. The water bubbles and hisses oheorily in tho urn, and presiding genius of it, and cor tainly not tho least pleasant object in the room is Mina Gledfern herself. A slim, dainty figuro in a simple black dress, with white ruflles at tho throat and wrists; a small.piquant,yet intellectual faco, with keon, sparkling, dark eyos, and a pro fusion of soft, curly, dark hair cropped close. There is a quick play of expression ovor her features, from grave to gay; evory thought seems to express itsolf in the small face. Just now hor forohead is contracted with a slight frown as she glances impatiently at her brother, who, after leisuroly surveying the eatables and finding nothing that his fastidious tasto can condemn, sinks loisurely into his chair and begins to skim through some letters. ""Ardrossan will bo here next week,"" ho observes ; ""he sends his love,and your letter will bo here to-morrow "" ""Can't I read for myself t"" asks Mina, stretching her hand for the letter ; but her brother is deeply engrossed in another by this time.and its contents seem to displease, for without even answering his sister he crosses to the fire and tosses the letters in among the flames. ""I wonder why one always gets beastly letters on a wet morning, ' ho growls. ""Ugh; how I hate rain ; do you think it will over be fine any moro ?"" Mina, in a carolois tono.rominds him that as is early spring, and that thoy must look for rain, Erie makes an impatient ro joinder, and breakfast proceeds in silence. Suddenly Mina looks at her brothor with an angry gleam in her dark eyes, and says slowly ""Ardrossan wishes us to bo married this summer."" "" Then why tho duce don't you get married ? I am suro thore is nothing to prevent it,"" ""Married"" repeated Mina scornfully, "" with about four gowns to my namo. No thank yon.

"" Well, all I havo to say is, that Lord Ardrossan will leave to wait a whilo for his brido at that rate"" and Eric roao from his chair and glanced angrily at his sister, and thon walkod to tho window and stood grazing moodily into tho little sopping garden. .

Hero he had met hor future husband. Her tright face and unaffected manner had won 'iord Ardrossan where many a fashionable islle bad failed. Eric had hailed the news with pleasure on his return, and brother and sister had taken up their abode in the tiny cottage again. Mina was a warm-heaifced littlo girl, and loved her brother dearly, but h« was always giving her pain by exhibitions of his un worthy selfishness, and now she sits with swelling heart, realising how little he means to deny himself in order to further her interests) Eric Glonfern is a handsome man. A tall alhletio figuro, firmly knit with its broad square shoulders, and well-shapod head with a profusion of dark curly h»ir. His dark grey eyes aro full of lights and shadows, like his sister's, and his regular features, aquiline nose, and heavy drooping dark moustache made up a voritablo ""ladies darling."" In disposition he is fickle, selfish and weak, and his actions quite belie she kindly expression of his face. But of all things Adonis detested quarrel ling with a woman, so he crosses to Mina, and laying his hand on her shoulder Bays laughlingly, ""Don't fret old girl. Some thing will turn up. You shall have your gowns even if I go to the Jews for tho money. Hullo ! thore goes a carriage from Keep. Three passengers. I wonder which of tho family it is that remains at home. Lot me see.— There's the old buffers and two girls in the family. Miss Holmsley, daughter, a wealthy heiress, and Miss Con stance Hehnsley, the niece, a protty depen dant.""

""Your administrative qualities are ad mirable,"" laughed Eric, ""the lady might not be agreeable to play the part of ""beni ficent fairy "" to a broken up swell my dear."" "" Well, I mean to cultivate the money bags one and all, lor your espeoial benefit."" "" Oh lot it rest,"" said Eric impMiontly, ""you aro always harping on ono string, money from morning till night."" Mina glanced at her brother shrewdly under he: dark lashes, but wisely said no more, and trusting to his innate selfishness left her remarks to ramble and tako root. It would seem as though the travellers had taken tho raining olements with thorn j for presently tho thick clouds rolled back, and the sun shone out gloriously.

Eric throws asido his magazine with a yawn, and toss ing his Glengary on his shapoly head loiters down tho little garden path, out through the gato and up the road is the direction of tho Keep.

Sill,—The consideration of thte important subject has for somo considerable time past claimed your attention in a series of articles from time to time, to be found in the issues of your valuable paper. Your article in last Saturday's issue upon tho proper train ing of the rising generation in our public schools is of the greatest interest to our country and rural districts, and of which more may be said hereafter. But as some considerable time must elapse before those receiving instruction in our schools can bring the knowledge they could acquire into use, are there not thoso of older years to whom instruction could be imparted? They could at oncu put their knowledge into practice when acquired, to their own profit, and thus add to the general welfare and prosperity of the community at large. It is quite certain that the subject of agricul tural education is little understood, and lers appreciated by the tillers of the soil than it should be, and whilst the nations of the continent, by steadily keeping this branch of technical educa tion to the front, have been able t>supply large quantities of produce of all kinds for the food supply of the people of Great Britain, we, as u colony, have not yet done that which we ought and might have done. We have despised in this, as in other matters, the ""day of small things ; therefore we are suffering from poverty— the word is ugly, no doubt, but is true. In the future we must look to ourselves, and not to our Government, in these matters. A gentleman in Waikato, who is well known for his agricultural knowledge ac quired by technical training long ago in the Old Land, has been able to grow between 30 and 40 bushels of wheat to the acre upon ground which under other conditions would grow but little at all. He was also, through his knowledge of chemistry, in the early days of the manufacture of artificial manures able to make his own superphos phate and other fertilisers, and by their ap plication upon the land of his farm in York shire, converted a comparative barren hold ing into a most profitable and rich-growing wheat land. The same land would not keep at one time one cow in full milk, but when this gentleman left for New Zealand there were on it 20 animals, fat and sleek, and producing an abundance of milk and butter. Thus t.or technical kuowledge well applied. The markets of England are at our feet. Now, for the laying hold of our present opportunities. Could not some thing of the kind be attempted, whilst our Government are negotiating for the services of Professor Long ? (whose able articles in the Yorkshire Post have been my delight for some time). Let our excellent paper The Waikato Times publish in its columns a series of agricultural lesson*, beginning perhaps with agricultural chemistry or other portions of the subject ; and after a time let examination papers bo issued to committees formed in various centres, and prizes given for the best results obtained. Our young man would then have an oppor tunity of receiving instruction, and become interested in a subject which to them and us is of the greatest importance.—l am, c. Settler.

Chappie figures as a champion of the anti gold-producing party that at odd times put, forth their views in your paper. Mr thapple writes as it the gold miners had never paid a cent for the goidiields area, wlk-u the opposite is in reality the fact. I may as well remind Mr Chappie that in miners' rights fees alone the minerß have paid 10 times over the value for land mcd for gold mining, and they have as much right to the goldfields, aud mo»t likely a great deal more, than Mr Chappie has to his laud in the neighbourhjod of Tinkers, or any other goldfields district. If Mr Chappie will kindly give the area of his hold ing and the price at which he purchased it from Government, and any other particulars he can fossick up on the subject, I will attend to him in a future communication with pleasure. Mr Chappie complains that miners destroy the land, while farmers on the other hand improve it. Ihat is a cut throat description of lojtio to use. as gold is the most coveted article in daily us. Mr Chappie has only to make a few inquiries, or, perhaps, take his own case, and he will Boon discover that what the gold miners produce is the very thing that everyone -farmers and stockowners included— are labouring from early morn to dewy eve to possess, and continually complaiinng that it is a difficult matter to gjt even a fair share of it. Mr Chappie must know that if gold production does not keep pace with the increase of population all over the world, then the result is depression and dull times to all kinds of industries— the farming and stock raising industries included. I cannot conclude this letter in a more suitable manner than by copying a few remarks made by the talented ana, able lady contributor to -the Witness' Ladies' page ""Alice' in her late letter from Melbourne.

Mr Allen noticed Audrey's abstraction, and surmis ing something of the truth, proposed that they ppend a couple of weeks travelling and sight seeing. But Audrey languidly objected, paying; she preferred the quiet and. solitude of their mountain r»_ treat. But something happened to change this decision. A number of the neighbours planned an excursion to a neighbouring mountain, where they went every year to gather ra?pberue« for winter pve-eives, and, thinking it might be an enjoyable novelty to our city friends, they extended an invitation to them to accompany the party. Audrey and Rich wero quite sure they would enjoy it ; but Mrs Allen thought the distance too great and tho exertion too weaibome for ono of her yoava and preferred to remain at home. When the day arrived, however, Audrey was suffering from a nervous headache, and unable to leave her bed. Rich was greatly disappointed, and would gladly have remained at home with her, but, she insi?ted that he could dc hei no possible good — that he mu«t go ; so he finally, though reluctantly, consented There was a party of eight besides him self, four of whom wero young people. They worked busily all the fmenoon, and pails and basket-"" were rapidly filled with tho fragrant, crimson fruit, and when tho dinner hour camo every one was hungry for the cold chicken, tongue, and ham, bread and cheese, and doughnuts, and all those homely dainties that never ta«te as well anywhere ol^e as they do in the country Then, as they lounged about, after they had dined, for an hour or so before resum ing their berry-picking, Rich, boy-like, started off by himself upon an exploring expedition. He loved the mountains and forests : they inspired him with awe and reverence by their grandeur and strength. "" They are the eternal hills, Aunt Audrey,"" he had said on the evening of their arrival at that Vermont farm-honpe, and drawing a deep bteath of appreciation, while his thoughtful glance went up to the summit of the verdure-crowned mountain^* before them. He loved to wander about, and was always hunting for some rare and beautiful trophy to take back to Miss Waldemar To-day he came across some lovely gray lichens, and knowing how delighted phe would be with them, he fashioned a little basket out of some slender twik's,decorating it, with partridge vines and berries, and then filled it with his treasures. ft was a dainty little woodland offering, and after it was completed he went on climbing the steep mountain side, until suddenly he emerged from the dense forest into a road. He looked surprised at finding himpolf upon the highway, while a little way below him he espied a horse and carriage drawn up upon one side of it, under the shade of a large tree. There was a lady sitting in the carnage alone, and leaning back among the cushions as it either weary or ill. The horse was very restless, for the flies were worrying him, but though the lady held the reins and spoke to him soothingly from time to time, he was still very impatient. Thinking that his assistance might be required, Rich advanced, and saw that the lady was an inyaiid. She had very dark glossy hair, large, beautiful black eyes, which, however, had a very sad expression. Rich lifted his cap politely as he came up to the carriage, while he asked, with heightened colour : ' ' Are you in any trouble, madam ; is there anything that I can do to help you ?"" The lady leaned forward at the sound of his voice, and' smiled pleasantly upon him. as she replied : ' ' "" "" • "" There is nothing tho matter, thank you. only I was very thirsty, and my husband lelt mo beneath the ahrido of this tive, whih he wont back to a spring further down tho mountain, to got mo a dxink.

""Theilies aro very troublesome,"" Rich ob^oived, stepping up to tho horse and brushing seveial of those tormentors from his sleek coafc "" Yos, they have troubled him ever since we started this morning. We are travell ing in our own carriage because I am not able to endure the fatigue ot a public con veyance. But what a lovely little basket I you havo thoro ; and whero did you find those rare lichens ?"" she asked, her eyes brightening as the caught sight of Rich's treasures. "" I gathered them on tho mountain eido and they axe very pretty, I think ""' Then he added us the horse became still more restive : "" Theic is a w eed that prows along theso mountain roads that will keep the (lies oft"". May I get somo and put it in the bridle ?"" ""Yes, indeed do, if you are willing to take tho trouble,"" ehe responded, ea^orly. ""I havo suffered all the morning tosco our poor Piincein such torturo "" Rich carulully dopositGd his baskob where it could come to no harm, then stepped a-ido into tho bushes to break ?ome ot tho so called ' mufr-quito's weod ' which there in abundance, and which ho hud seen the f armors of that region put about their horses to keep tho flies and other insects off As ho did so there was a violent rustling among the grass near him, and then a momentary sensation of horror thrilled him, as bomething black, and loathsome, and writhing, darted by him. Looking back ho saw a huge black snake wriggling and winding his way actors the road, sweeping its coils ovei tho horses very hoof-? as it went., find then disappear ing among the bushes beyond The animal gave u staitlcd prnii, rcaied upon \u< hind feet, andy/asd v/as about, to pis o frantic plunge torward, when Kirh, with wonderful presence of mind, sprang to his side, seizing him (irmly by tho bndlc, and then ho befjan to pat him softly and to talk to him reassuringly. The l'idy in the carriage hud uttered a cry ot affii»ht, then sho sank bick among her cushions, palo, and almo-t fainting. "" Do not be alarmed, madam,"" said Rich. ""The horse will be quiet in a few moment?."" Ji-Hfc at that instant he heard a quick step behind them, and glancing back ho saw a noble-looking man approaching, beating in his hand a silver cur> tilled with water. ""What is the matter?"" ho questioned, bonding a look ot alarm upon hi? palo and trembhngwife, and then turning a surpii&ed glance upon Rich. The lad explained what had occurred, but taking the blame of it all upon himself for having disturbed and routed the stiake fiom his hiding-place. "" Uere, Ida, drink some of {his water— it will revive you, and you have nothing more to fear from Prince,"" the gentleman said, passing vhe cup to his wife, and gently releasing the reins from her almost con vulsi\ r e gra^p. She sat up, smiling faintly. ""I was very much startled,"" she said, "" and if it had not been for this young man I am sure Prince would have had a frightful run."" ""I do not doubt it,'' herhusbandroturned. { * Some horses are mora easily frightened by a prake than human beings are. I think we owe a great deal to you, my young friend,"" turning to Kich, ""notwithstanding J.Oll a-sume all the blame, for his snake ? hip was just as liable to make his appearance it you had not been heie. I think you had a great deal of presence of mind, as well as courage."" Rich coloured at this high praito, and murmured something about their overesti mating what he had done. ""Are you feeling better, Ida?"" the gentle man a-ked, as hi& wifw drained the cup of its contents and set it down on the cushion beside her. "" Yep, thank you, I am much refreshed, thouyh a triile weak yet The water was deliciou<ly pure and cool,"" she answered, striving to speak cheerfully. "" Would you like another drink from the spring ?"" her husband asked. Rich t-prang eagerly forward. ""I should be very glad to go and get it for you,"" he paid. ""No, I thank you ; you are very kind, but 1 do not need any more,"" she replied, smiling, and bending a wistful look upon his dark, hand&ome face. ""But I should like to know your name, for I shall always remember you very gratefullyr "" My name is Richmond Waldemar."" Rich saw her ca«t a startled glance at her husband a^ he spoke his last name, and following it ho noticed that the ruddy colour all faded out of the face of tho p r oud man, while the hand that was smoothing his need's glo^y coat began to tremble. "" ""Waldemar— ""Waldcmar,"" he said, in a meditative tone, while he bent down to pick a wisp of hay from Prince's leg, "" I used to know some people of that name, years ago. I wonder if you aie a— a relative oi a— Miss Audrey Waldemar."" ""She is my aunt, sir,"" Rich returned surprised that he should know anything of hor. "" Your aunt ! I did not know that sho had a brother."" "" No, sir, ?he never did ; but I was given to her by some one when I was quite j oung, and I have always called her Aunt Audrey."" ""Ah i yes -yes; I hope she is well,"" and the gentleman's lipa twitohed painfully over tho words. "" Very well, I thank you,"" Rich answered wondering at the man's increasing omotion. ""Arthur, isn't it time we were moving on ?"" his wife here interposed, in a tone that struck Rich as being: somewhat plain tive, and glancing at her he =aw that she had grown very sad and was watching her husband with an anxious expression. He started as if suddenly recalled to him self, and going up to her said, gently, and with an accent of self-reproach : ""Yes, yes, it is ; and you must be very tired, dear."" Prince had become entirely composed by this time, and Rich, leaving him, picked up his little basket, which he had so carefully deposited out of harm's way before tho ex citement, and held it out to the pale woman. "" You are pleased with this, naad^m,"" he said, modestly ; "" will you accept it ?"" Her face, lighted, and rich thought her great dark eyes the loveliest he had ever seen. ""Thank you, dear,' she said heartily. ""I shall bo so glad to have it, and I shall arrange thcee mosses and lichen on card board, and frame and keep them as a souvenir of this day "" Rich flushed with pleasure that she could care enough for his modest gift to take all that trouble. "" I wish 1 had something to give you in return,"" she added. ' ""You surely deserve a medal for your courage and presence of mind to-day. I wonder if you could wear this ring,"" and she drew off a plain gold ring— the guard to a diamond -from one of her fingers, and passed it to him. He slipped it upon the third finger of his left hand, and it proved to be iust a fit. ■ ""lam glad you can wear if-,,"" the lady said, with a pleased smile; ""keep it to remember me by, rand I hope we shall meet again come timo."" "" I am afraid it is a great deal more than I deserve,"" Rich said,"" in a doubtful tone : "" but it is a very nice keepsake, and I shall always wear ib.""' ""Are you spending the summer in this region?"" the gentleman now asked. "" Yes, eir, we came to Fairview, five or six miles from here, to spend the month.3 of July and August."" ""Well, it is a lovely country,"" the man said, with a sigh, as ho turned toward his carriage, adding : "" I hope you will not en counter his snakesbip again during any of your rambles."" ""But I wish I might, sir,"" Bich responded, eagerly. ""I think I should really enjoy settling his account for him, to pay tor the frig;hi which he has given tho lady."" ""Well, well, I believe I must shake hands with you for that,"" returned tho other, with a genial smile, while he stepped up to Bich, laying one hand on his shoulder — and the boy could feel ib trembling there — while he grasped his hand heartily with the other. "" By the way,"" he added, as if suddenly remembering something. ""I am afraid we have been remiss — we have not even intro duced ourselves, and you will be wondering who has reaped the benefit of your kindness and courage to day Here is something to put in your pocket-book, and if ever you need a friend, just drop a line to this ad dreps and I will not fail you."" Ue handed Rich hia card as ho ; then getting into his carriage, he bowed ; tho lady smiled and waved her white hand, and they drove on. "" Arthur M. Halstead, Albany, N.

However, my .cousin Dick found him self landed at Gralveston with six or seven bits in his pocket, and the wide prairie before him. . Those who never saw a prairie are apt to imagine them a kind of cross between a billiard table and a gentleman's lawn. How different is the reality. A wide ex •pance of rolling— no other word can suitably express the regularity of the very irregularity of the ground — plains covered with rank, coarse grass, here and there broken by-rising hummocks, or deep ravines with precipitous bluffs : such are the salient features of a prairie landscape. Well, Dick found it no good hanging about the settle ments, so he engaged in the capacity of stockrider, or vaquero, on an up country rancho^ As he was a fearless and skilful horseman, he soon won the confidence 5 of his employer, who had been one of the pioneers, and hailed from Kentucky. Seth Jones, — for such was his name,r- was a strange character, fearless as a buffalo and tender-hearted as a woman. He was well known as a deadly shot ; and no Comanche dared molest his property, so well kuown was the deadly accuracy of his aim. Nor'- was his daughter .Kate behind in* those, manly accom plishments. !Never, indeed, did a fairer Amazon 'bewitch an unfortunate mortal by more brilliant deeds of '*derring-do.' Dick- • was tolerably happy ; he alternately on shoot ing excursions with the father and love-making expeditions:. », with the daughter. It was midsummer, and the burning heat of 'the sun had parched the herbage and dried up all the pools, when Seth and my cousin rode out to have, a shot at the buffalo. . They were both well armed, and were attended by several peons, whose duty was to stampede the game towards the hunters. On they rode, Seth pouring out many a strange narrative of peril ous adventures with, reds, or 'yaller belMes.' Suddenly, away in the dis tance, they-observed a troop of horses. ' A manada ! ' cried Dick ; and eager to try the mettle of his horse against the wild mustangs, he would have pressed forward. ' '""Wait, lad, .-■vyait,' said Seth, as he eagerly scanned} the animals.

Eound and round the tree they circled, singing the death song, and hulking their tomahawks, with so perfect an accuracy that, while every veapon grazed his head, riot one ever broke the skin. Dick never flinched; and it was evident some severer trial of his courage must be attempted. Dry fuel was heaped round his feet and set fire to, while the braves yelled and gesticu lated without the firey circle, which seemed to separate him from. the .world.

Eor a time the savages seemed stupi fied by so daring a rescue, and the pair had got several yards of a start. Then with one impulse they rushed towards their rifles, which had been piled before beginning the torture, and would have fired had not the voice of their chief restrained them. ' Slay not the singing bird of the Y^ngees ; she will make music in the wigwam of a Comanche chief,' he exclaimed; and accordingly, without firing, the whole band rushed upon Kate and Dick.

Beggars of all descrip tions, from the clerical and ebaritabls sub subscription people down to the professfonal ""reduced lady"" and ""gentlemen that had seen better times, ' got out "" their hats and letters."" In fact, for some time Melbourne forgot its political and social controveisies, for which it is so famous, and thought and spoke of nothing but the young millionaire, Mr. Herbert Gifford. An enterprising pho thographer, who had taken Herbert's like ness as he was on his way to his father's deathbed, had hundreds of copies struck oft"", and thby were eagerly bought athalf-a-crown eaoh. I wairant many a yonng heart, beating in a feminine bosom, throbbed at the sight of that finely developed form, that soulful, hand sojrco face, crowned with a glory of curling ch'edtnut hair — tho photographer's colourist had been successful in giving the hues faith fully. The illustrated papers had portraits of the dead capitalist, "" the worthiest o£ our pioneers "" (the writers of the obituaries were nearly driven to suicide to find something good to say of the deceased) and his son, and all agreed it was marvellous how old Sourface could have begotten so bright a being as Herbert Gifford. All this time, when Melbourne was so ex cited ovr him, and the wave had even reached sleepy, money-grubbing Sydney, Herbert re mained at Oorathule station. His father was buiied in the cemetery which he had himself selected. It waa the first spot on which he had ""squatted"" in Victoria, and he had washed his clothes in the neighbour ing creek, while "" resting "" on Sunday, f [ere old settlers who knew him often came to look at the grave of the pioneer. The will had been read and made public, and Herbert woald soon have to visit Melbourne to take up the load the dead man had so unwillingly laid down, and to spend weeks with business i men and lawyers, ne delayed purposely, dreading the dry details, and the round of parties he would have to encounter. It was a pleasant place, Corathule, an u adulating basaltic country in the Western District, eternally green and clothed with clumps of trees that made it look like an English park. Herbert had been born in the old fashioned homestead ; here he had spent his childhood, saddened only by the melancholy of his mother, a tender, spiritual woman of the rarest beauty, who would have died broken hearted at a forced union with a repulsive nature, a nature ihafc knew nofcliing but money, had not God sent her this bright, loving, chestnut-haired boy. She had died as ho was well in his teens, commending him with her last breath to his generous Giver, and passing away full of the assurance that as He had accorded such a mercy He would watch over her treasure when she was gone. A? for Mr. Gifford, he never troubled about these matters. His wife's beauty and the beauty of the child she had brought him, he had never seen— he never saw any beauty except in a sovereign. He had married her because she was heiress to the station ad joining Corathule, and in the hope that she would provide him with an heir, for he had sworn an oath not to leave anything to his relatives, who had been guilty of the heinous crime of poverty all their lives. When he was seventeen, Herbert, some months after his mother's death, went to England and passed Oxford with credit. In the old laud he made many sincere friend ships. He was distinguished, however, during his stay in England for seeking the company of intellectual persons, and rather avoiding the dissipations of the collegians, though he was by no means an anchorite. In London he generally spent the time in literary and artistic cirolea, and formed somewhat a contrast to his fellow-Aus tialian btudents, v/ho, when they got to that great city, seemed to try and outdo Circe's swine in wallowing in the mud r>f filthy pleasure. After passing Oxford, Herbert, with his father's consent— grudg ingly given, though Herbert was spending the money his mother left him, which the old man thought should havo been invested in station property — travelled all over the Con tinent, spending much time in Italy, where his warm temperament several times nearly entangled him with the stgnore. After a trip in Asia Minor and Palestine, he returned to England, and then pioceeded to Australia by way of America, in which he spont several months, arriving in Australia in timo to be present at his father's de^th. • His trip across the Pacific inspired him with ideas wnich he afterwards carried into effect, the purchase of a yacht leading to one of the great incidents of his life. His visit to Melbourne was a vast disap pointment. He applied himself to business in the most exemplary manner, declined most invitations to parties and dinners (excusing himself on the plea of the recent death of hia father), subscribed to religious and public in stitutions only upon a modest scale, never replied to the thousand begging letters and "" projects "" he received, and was not onoe geen in the haunts of ""life."" He was a pretty constant attendant at the theatres, particularly if opera was on, but amused him self by leading the newest works at home, practising the latest music, for he was a taste ful pianist; and entertaining at quiet dinners, followed by decorous card or music parties, the few persons in Melbourne for whom he had an esteem. To the ladies he was utterly j indifferent, much to the surprise of those who knew well enough he was fond of the sex. At first the matrons bewailed this, but when they found their chits snubbed, they cried out against Herbert. He didn't want virtuous females, they said ; he was a profligate ; he had left his heart in Italy ; probably lie had married there. He would yet be indicted for bigamy. Then they decried the practice of sending money out of the oountry by educat ing lads in England. After all what wag he, with his two millions— only the son of a man who had been a shepherd in Scotland. Harry Forbe3 was wealthier than Herbert. The sharpers suffered perhaps the most, for they had looked upon Herbert's thousands as good as money in their pockets, and, as one of them graphically said, ""he didn't come worth a hang"" — you may depend the lan guage waa stronger than that. But he miglu "" come"" yet. As for the fast young men who were going to the devil their own way, they agreed Herbert was a milksop, and not worth knowing— a virtuous resolution, seeing he would not know them. i am not going to say that Herbert was a saint, nor that during this time he was visibly moved, but as a matter of fact I think ho was pietty free from taint. Idleness is the paient of vice, and for months after Herbeit came to reside in Melbourne he had hardly a spare hour. Wealth had its duties, and hard enough they were at first. Indeed, after a fortnight's attempt to master the giant business which his father had conducted without an apparent effort, Herbert was on the point cf throwing up the whole affair, and appointing a sort of commission to carry it on. He could not catch the many threads that went towards raakiug that mighty web. Bnt when ho reflected that to surrender would be to acknowledge he -\\as not as good a man as his father, whose abilities he had always looked down upon — he thought very differently now — the proud boy could not bear such an idea. So he set his teeth, and while other men in his position would have been revelling in pleasure, he mastered every hard, dry, practical detail. At first this was a terrible task, against which his soul, which inclined to the romantic and sentimental, and loved ease, revolted ; but gradually he grew to like the work. And why? Man is an animal that likes power ; it is the greatest of the passions. And as Herbert grappled with his business, as he began to understand it, he came to know what a terrible power he had, how much depended upon his will. He held the fates of hundreds of employe? in his hands. Indireotly, he could sway the markets, and thus deoide the fate o£ the masses. Ha was the Bovine Ban'c, which held so many mighty men in its grasp. But for a circum stance that presently occurred, Herbert might have been swallowed up by thia lust of power, and gradually becomj what his father had been, though never so mean or penurious. He had his mother's generous, loving nature, and could never become unjust, ungenerous, or ungrateful. When he had firmly grasped the reins and had everything well in hand, Herbert effected a revolution that fairly scared the squatting and mercantile community of Australia, aaa made them "" squatter "" like a lot of frightened ducks. He had a list of every employe made out, and was shocked at the wages given, considering the profits made, especially the salaries of men who had grown gray in his father's service. Old Milburn, the head clerk, who managed the business, had absolutely become an automaton, without a tl'.onght except work, which he carried on late into the night. The surprise of that starched, formal and one-sided gentleman, when Her bert gave him back the list with increases of 50 to 100 per cent, marked thereon, cannot be described. He almost had a fit. He pored over it all day, and concluded swift and speedy ruin was at hand, so imbued had he become with the ideas of the man who had mastered him and made him but a mere machine. But Her bert's orders were peremptory, and by his direction the changes were telegraphed, with orders not to let the newspapers know, for Herbert had a dread of the fuhome flatteries the servile press showered upon him, and that night throughout Australia, from the burn ing lands of the far north of Qaeensland to the temperate latitudes of New Zealand, for he had property in every colony, there was held wild holiday on the G-ifford stations. It ' is reported that on the Benjelmajingah Sta tion on tha Diamentina, no one was sober for a fortnight — it would have been an insult to walk straight. On that day Herbert made happy many a home and many a heart, and if Heaven hears the prayers of the grateful surely it would make the young man's path a pleasant one. When the Melbourne monetary world heard of this proceeding next day a hub bub was raised to which that of Ephesus was but a mere trifle. They would now have to increase the rates — at least those who had stations adjacent to Gifford, and there stared at them from the walls the reduction in their profits that meant a loss. This action was the reversal of all the fundamental principles of the financiers of Australia, that the more profit that was received the less should be paid to the employes. Herbert, however, had the general public with him, and eloquently defended himself. He asserted that all troubled of modern days were caused by the extremo inequality of the earnings of wages and capital, and urged that the holders of the latter were unwise to provoke the former. The horror that these opinions created in the bosoms of the old skinflints who directed»the operations of capital in Melbourne was in describable. They thought the pit was open ing under their feet. These men had once been laborers themselves, and had risen to their position through purely fortuitous oir cumstances, though of course they possessed , shrewdness and cleverness, but no more than men they left behind them in the old land, and who never got higher than a foreman's place. :",Fiction

From her dark covert, With nil her snakes erect upon her bi euat, She stalks in view, und ikes Mm with her charms. Young, Revenge. More running than walking, Leslie pursued his road eastward, keeping the top of the Downs, on a desolate track through copses and over long plains covered with thin grass. The birds in the air, or a couple of hares or rabbits starting from their retreats and running across his path, were the only living things he met with, and the deep solitude reigning all around set his imagination at work, making him brood over plans of ven geance and retaliation. But as the sight of the hills bounding the camp at Aldershot had led him to think of his own horrible punish ment, so now the cloud-atmosphere of the great metropolis he was approaching brought him to reflect upon the far deeper injury which the author of his wrongs had done to his sister; and he promised to himself to battle in her cause before his own. The track along the Downs merged, at the end of a couple of hours, into a broader field lane, running in a north-easterly direction, which again fell into a turnpike road, with houses on either side. Inquiring of a child the name of the place, Leslie was told that he had come to the village of Great Bookham, and that a mile and a half further on he would reach the town of Leatherhead. It had got quite dark by this time, and having lost all fear of being"" pursued, the deserter entered a public-house to procure some food and drink, of which he stood greatly in need. He had not sat down many minutes when a country man with a whip in his hand, came into the room, and took a place at the table opposite to him, with a gruff "" Good evening."" There ensued a short conversation, in the course of which Leslie learnt that his new acquaintance was carrying a load of corn to the London market, and would not be unwilling to give him a seat in his cart. The bargain was soon concluded, and five minutes after the corn waggon with its two inmates rumbled off to wards the metropolis. Though much inclined to beguile the long night hours by pleasant chat, the man with the whip did not derive that gratification from Leslie, who composed himself to rest almost as soon as the cart had got in move ment. The sleep at first was a pretence, designed to prevent inquiries regarding his occupation and movements ; but the fatigues of the day converted it into a reality before long, and by the time the cart was rattling over the pavement of the old town of Leatherhead, the harassed mind of the fugitive from Aldershot Camp had gone into the land of dreams. It was not before the cart had nearly ap proached the suburbs of London that Leslie roused himself from his sound slumber. The dawn of another day was breaking, and a mountain of crimson clouds in the east was darting forward feeble rays of light through an ocean of fog and smoke, everlasting garment of the immense city. Looking around from the cart, the awakened sleeper perceived that he had come close to Battersea, and having considered for a moment his position, he asked bis companion to allow him to descend. The man stopped his horses with a little growl, but which changed into a broad smile on receiving a gratuity slightly larger than that stipulated. Hurrying on with light step, Leslie made his way rapidly through the silent streets of Battersea towards the old wooden bridge, at the foot of which the sleepy guardian stopped him for a moment to receive the halfpenny toll. The bridge crossed, he hurried onward through Chelsea and part of Brompton, not resting till he reached a small street lined on both sides with low but neat-looking dwelling houses, each fronted by a little railed-in garden. Before one of these houses he 6topped, and, approaching the door, made a movement as if to ring the bell. But before he had touched the brightly-polished handle his arm sank at his side. ""No, no!"" he murmured, falling back a step ; "" the shock might be dangerous ; I will wait."" Shutting the little garden-gate softly, Leslie went back into the street, pacing up and down with an eye upon the windows of the house he had quitted. All the blinds were drawn, showing that not one of the inmates had yet arisen, while a feeble glimmer from one of the upper windows spoke of a late burning night-light and a chamber of sickness. Looking at the glimmer, the wanderer in the street hid his face in his hands. Gradually, with the rays of the full morn ing sun shining down upon the pavement, the little street got more lively. The heavy march of the policeman, who cast an inquisitive eye towards the labourer in the middle of the street, but walked on in meditative mood on perceiving that he carried no bundle, and that his pockets were empty to all appearance, was foEowed by the nimble trot of the baker's boy, and the more steady pace of the milk woman, carrying her pails from house to house, and uttering at each station a thin howl, imitative of the greeting of her cows. Leslie bestowed great attention upon the latter person, who after a little while reached the dwelling before which he was keeping watch, and gave a single knock at the door. He stepped up to her af.the moment, and had no sooner done so when the door was opened from within, and an elderly female, of a cast of features denoting the Irish type, appeared on the threshold. "" Sure and faith ! "" she exclaimed, getting sight of the figure behind the milk- woman ; "" and is it you, Master Robert ? "" ""Hush, hush, Bridget!"" interrupted the stranger, making a gesture commanding silence ; "" take your milk, and I will speak to you in the parlour."" The servant did as re quested, and a moment after rejoined the young man in a small room on the ground floor, furnished simply, but with much taste. ""You have left the army, Master Robert ?"" began the excited female, almost before she had closed the door at her back. ""Yes; lam a deserter !"" replied Leslie, drily, ; ""but please, Bridget, don't speak so loudj and answer the few questions I have come to ask as briefly as you can. ""A deserter I You a deserter! Good gracious, you don't say so 1 "" ejaculated Bridget, throwing her arms above her head, in an attitude of wonder and despair. "" If you are not quiet, I shall leave at once 1"" Leslie exclaimed, making a movement to rise from the chair he had taken. "" Yes, I will— l will, Master Robert 1"" cried Bridget, lifting up her hands imploringly; "" only say what I can do ?"" "" Well, tell me first, how is my father?"" asked Leslie. "" Oh, he is very, very poorly,"" replied the old servant; ""he's not left the house for more than a month, and I'm afraid[is fretting his life out."" ""And how is my sister?"" inquired the deserter, feeling something like a choking sensation in his throat on asking the question. Bridget was silent for a few seconds. Then, looking her interlocutor full in the face, and pointing to her forehead, she ex claimed—"" Miss Effie is better there, but she has got, oh ! so pale and thin, eating little, taking scarce any 6leep, and talking day and night of him."" ""Of whom ? "" Leslie called out ; but quickly correcting himself, added — "" I know, 1 know ; say nothing more, Bridget."" Hold ing his hand before his eyes for a moment, he went on, slowly articulating his words. "" Tell me, Bridget, and tell me truly, do you think my sister still loves the fellow who brought her to ruin."" "" Ah, Master Robert, I'm sure she does, and I can take my solemn oath upon it,"" re plied the servant ; "" I have seen her kiss his portrait over and over again, and since her poor head got better she lias written no end of letters to him, though he answers none "" The deserter rose from his seat. "" That's enough,"" he exclaimed, extending his hand ; "" good-bye, Bridget ! "" "" Sure, and you'll not go away without seeing your father, Master Robert !"" the servant cried in astonishment. "" Yes, 1 must go, for it would only distress him to see me,"" Leslie answered, in mournful tone ; "" besides, the police will very likely be after me in an hour or two, so that I must not tarry on this account."" ""Don't stop, then, pray don't, Master Robert,"" cried the old servant, "" but keep out of the way, for the life of you."" *• You need not be afraid, Bridget ; I shall take care of myself,"" replied the deserter, with a faint smile, making his way to the door. He was going to open it, when he seemed to remember something and went once more to address the servant. "" Years ago, before you came to live with us, Bridget,"" he said, "" I think you were in the service of a Jew in the City— a money lender and dealer in gold and jewellery, whom I have heard you often praise for his honesty. Can you give me his present ad dress ?» Bridget looked at her master's son with wide-open eyes. "" Sure I can tell you where Mister Sadok lives, for I only saw him last week,"" she replied, hesitatingly ; "" but if it is as you want a little money, perhaps, if you will excuse, I might give it you, as I have a trifle in the savings bank."" "" Thank you, Bridget, you are very kind,"" interrupted Leslie, pressing the hand of the old servant ; "" but I would rather not take your hard earned savings, for it may be that I prove a bad debtor. It is not necessary, mgreover, as I have got a diamond pin, and various other things which are of little use to me, and there will be no harm in turning them into money. So please tell rae Mr. Sadok's address ? "" ""As you -willl have it, Master Robert,"" re plied the servant, after another little hesita tion, "" Mister Sadok's house is in Bell-street, Whitechapel ; Ido not know the number, but you will find bis name over the door. And don't forget if you see Mr. Sadok to say to him that it was Bridget Malony, who nursed his children while they had the scarlet fever, who sent you to him. I'm sure he will treat you fairly if you tell him."" "" Thank you very much, Bridget,"" rejoined the deserter, opening the door, and passing out into the street. "" You may tell my father and sister,"" he added, in a half whisper, "" that you have seen me, but need add nothing more, unless, indeed, they find it out. You understand ?"" "" Yea, I understand, Master Robert,"" the old servant answered, with a nod of intelli gence. "" Well, good-bye, then, and make yourself perfectly easy about me until I call again, which I will do in a few days,"" Leslie went on ; and with a wave of the hand he strode away through the garden-gate, and the next moment was out of sight. Leslie had no difficulty in finding the house of Mr . Sadok, in Bell-street, Whitechapel. It was a heavy, dark-looking building, rather larger than the rest of the dwellings in the same thoroughfare, and distinguished from them, besides, by a massive oaken door and a row of iron-barred windows on the_ ground floor. It was only after having given his name and stated the object of his visit that Leslie was admitted into the presence of the owner of the house— a tall, stout man, rather above fifty, unmistakably Hebrew, though with nothing oriental in his features, but of the rosy complexioned, blue eyed type. Mr. Sadok fixed a singular look upon the young man in the labourer's -garb who came to offer his jewellery for sale, and having listened to what he had to say, asked several questions which made Leslie start. It was evident from the few words he uttered that the money-lender knew all the affairs of his family, including his sister's disgrace, and the flogging inflicted upon himself, and there was little doubt but that he guessed he was speak ing to a deserter. Leslie's first movement was one of vexation, which was allayed, however, when he noticed the kindly tone in which he was addressed, and the readiness of his interrogator to comply with his demands. Having received frank and truthful replies to his somewhat searching questions, Mr. Sadok, scarcely glancing at the articles offered to him for purchase, inquired how much money Leslie wanted ; and hearing the sum was twenty pounds, he, without another word, put as many sovereigns on the table. Leslie, pocketing the coin, was about to leave the room, when the money-lender addressed him once more. "" Call upon me again in a few days,"" he ex claimed, in an abrupt tone, "" and let me know whether I can be of any further service to you."" The young man bowed his head, feeling impressed, he scarce knew why. Then, ex claiming, "" I will call in a week,"" he made his parting salute to his strange acquaintance. The next four or five hours were spent by Leslie in the purchase of a suit of gentlemen's clothes, which he exchanged at a City hotel for his humble dress, and having partaken of a dinner at the same place, he sallied forth to wards the West -end, buying on the road a cane and a revolver, which he had loaded and primed. It was getting late in the afternoon, and the thoroughfares were crowded with car riages and pedestrians, but the wanderer had no eye for either the wealth and luxury displayed in files of equipages rolling along the main streets, or the poverty and vice creeping forth from narrow bye-lanes ; and, with only one thought in his mind, inquired his way for Princes-square. Arrived here, the first lounger he met with poiuted out to him the residence of Lord Fitzherbert. In reply to his inquiry as to whether Captain Astley was at home, the stately hall porter told Leslie that he had gone out, but was expected to return at eight in the evening, probably leaving again about nine, so that if he wished to see the Hon. Mr. Astley he must call between eight and nine. Having given his thanks for the information, Leslie sauntered forth again, not exactly knowing what to do next, or how to carry out his plans. Following the current of promenaders around him, he drifted into one the parks, and sat down on a bench, lost in thought. He had not long been there when two soldiers passed by, talking to each other. ""Do you think they'll catch him,"" said the first, an infantry corporal, to his com panion, a brother non-commissioned officer. ""I'm sure they will,"" was the prompt reply ; "" deserters never escape if their families or friends are known."" Leslie could hear nothing more of the conversation, which he instantly referred to himself, and springing to his feet as soon as the soldiers were a few yards off, he hastened away in an opposite direction . For a little while he fancied that every eye was turned upon him, and it was not before he had got out of the park, and into a very retired district, where scarce a soul was to be seen, that he began to breathe more freely. After wander ing about for some hours, through fields and lonely lanes, it got dark at last, Avhen, almost mechanically, he retraced his steps to Prince's square. The clock struck nine when he got opposite the mansion of Lord Fitzherbert, before the open door of which stood a small private carriage. A minute had not elapsed, and he was yet hesitating whether he should approach the mansion or not, when Captain Astley came out of it, ran down the broad steps, and threw himself into the carriage, which drove off at the same moment. Running at full speed, Leslie followed till he got, out of the square, and into a broad street, in the middle of which a number of hackney coaches were standing for hire. Jumping into the nearest, he hurriedly ordered the coachman to follow the private carriage in front, promising double fare if he kept close behind it. The cabman did not wait to be told twice, hut, whipping his horse into a gallop, had come up with the carriage in a moment, and steadily kept his vehicle at its back. The ride did not last above & quarter of an hour, when the object of pur suit came to a stop before a small house in a rather dark street. Captaia Astley instantly sprang from his carriage and gave a peculiar tap at the door, which opened the same moment, upon which disappeared in a dark passage. The carriage being gone, Leslie got out of his cab to pay the driver, who receiving even more than the sum he expected, put his finger to his hat, with a cheerful "" Thank you. Sir 1 "" The movement gave Leslie a new thought . ' "" Can you tell me, my dear fellow, whose ""house this is ? "" he eiclained, pointing to the tenement into which the Hon. Mr. Astley had gone. A broad grin overspread the cabman's face. "" I don't mind telling you, as you are a gentleman,"" he replied, in a half- whisper ; "" its a gambling house.""",Fiction

CHAPTER in, Mr Lambert, as a scientific farmer, middle-aged without a family, had accepted the offer of a pupil at a hundred guineas a year, a youth of 18 fresh from the agri cultural college at Cirencester ; and about the time of saving the first barley crop under the new rigime, the youth and his father made their appearance at Weston, having strolled over from the station at the market town, four miles distant. The farm bouse of Weston was an old manor bouse in the suburbs of the village. The stout gentleman with his hat off and a handkerchief with four knotted corners on his head, is Mr Cooper; the youth walking by his side is his son Horace. Mr Cooper, born at Weston half a century before, hrd been cast upon the world at an early age. Owing to the circumstances of the old regime and to other causes, Horace had never before seen Weston. <c So this is Weston,” he said ; fine old fashioned house. I shall like it the better as your birthplace. Won’t you put your hat on ?” Mr Cooper did so, leaving the knots of the handkerchief sticking out below. He was wrapt in thought. “Yes, my boy, my birthplace; and the shrine of my early affections, Horace.” With hand on heart, and handkerchief on head, and eyes fixed on the manor house, Mr Cooper marched past the nouse where he was born, and entered a meadow be yond. ‘Tis undoubtedly a hard fate that the shrine of one’s affections should pass into other hands; at least so Mr Cooper thought, in his present romantic mood. “ Weston at one time seemed mine as sure as fate,” said Mr Cooper. “My fathers had farmed it for a hundred years,” The companions had paused upon a bridge crossing the trout stream. “ Whaia pity it was not their property,” said Horace. “ Great pity,” replied Mr Cooper. “ How well I remember those gabled roofs and grey walls, and that ivied porch with the great sheltering elms, I used to cross this bridge twice a year in a very doleful state, taking the short cut to catch the coach for school ; and in my mind’s eye I still sc my mother craning over the laurel fence the-e before the door, to catch a last glimpse of her beloved and departing son. This stream was the Rubicon of those black Mondays ; beyond it lay school and drudgery, behind it lay Weston and the waving pocket handkerchiefs. My mother and sisters, and any accidental aunt who might be staying in the house at the time, used all to stand on tiptoe waving their pocket handkerchiefs, and shedding tears behind the laurels; and your father, Horaces used to wave his schoolboy cap, with his heart in his mouth, as he crossed this { bridge of sighs,’ ” Here Mr Cooper took off his hat and waved it, the four corners of his large silk handkerchief fluttering in the wind. a ‘Tis another proof of the immorality of the land laws,” said Mr Cooper, “ that land tiius endeared to a man’s heart should ever be alienated. By law divine, my boy, Weston should be ours. If you can find an opportunity of getting hold of the property, while you are here, without ask ing me to pay for it, be sure you embrace It.” An oaken table centuries old ran down one side of Mr Lambert’s kitchen, a rem nant of the old regime, and of older times still, and a wide open chimney with a bacon loft above, and seats in the corners, yawned on one side of that old-fashioned kitchen. In former days half a dozen farm servants had dined daily at the oaken table with the farmer’s family. That custom had de parted, but Mr Lambert was still endeavor ing to approach his laborers and win their sympathy by other means. At the table is seated a dozen men and boys with slates and books. This capacious kitchen was at present a sort of literary institute, where younir men (and even grey-beards, if they liked) might take up afresh the threads of learninr which some of them had dropped very prematurely at school. The visitors entered —Horace and his father. “ The old kitchen is not so much changed as I expected,” said Mr Cooper. “I should have known some, of you, ray friends, from your likeness to your fathers” —he turned to the table as he said this— “but I am glad to see, from your present occupation, that you will enjoy a better chance in life than they did.” Another day’s work is over in the fields, and the laborers of Compton are strolling homewards ; : the pheasants are crowing in the woods, and the vernal choir of birds, strengthened .by the arrival of their prima donna by the dozen from beyond the. Channel, are singing in every hedge and copse. ' It is glorious spring! The advent of the new era has become visible; the affairs of Compton are at the flood. Quoth William Hoots to his two com panions, walking homewards. "" The long-tails seems merry a-hopping np to roost; and well they may what’s left of 'm, for their enemies has become their friends.” “ I don't believe there’s a man in Comp ton as would wire or trap nothing, if you’d paid him never so well,” said William’s next neighbor ; “you and I have followed that trade, Bill, brisk as anybody.” “ Ah, and should again sooner than starve ; but howsomdever, there’s no call to expect the old squire agin, and as to the new 'mi, I hope he’ll get a good crop o’ longtails, and hares too, and kill ’em down early afore they gets out in the fields and does harm.” “ Shall ye manage to buy a cow one o’ these days ?” said William’s neighbor, “In course I shall,” replied William. “ Leastways, we shall manage it between us. My boy' is savin’ up fast as he can, and we means to club together, aud master says he’ll put L 5 to it if required, provided we affirms a cow club and insures the cow. Mr Lambert be something like a master he be.” “ I’d sooner work for him for nothing, than I’d work for a tread-me-down master for a pound a week,” said William’s neigh bor. “ I say Bill, I’ve actually got a sovereign along with the shop goods in this here blessed basket.” “ Seed ye take it, my lad. This dishclout business, or whatever ye calls it—money back, I mean, at the end of six months for them that pays ready money, is a first-rate plan.” “ Jest as good,” said William’s neigh bor, “ as having a pig put into your stye for nothing. So you’ll conquer your cow soon, shall you, Bill? I wish I could corner a cow, but I can’t. My missus ain’t adapted for the business.” Horace’s share in the progress of Comp ton proved to be considerable. He was a youth of very active habit. He began his day at six, and a busy day it was; but the longest labors never tired him, and fre quently in the vinter, when youths of less energy would have deemed the day s work sufficient, he would drudge into the county town, 4 miles off, through fields and lanes, through rough weather sometimes, and often in outer darkness, for the sake of an evening lecture at the literary institution, or an hour’s French or music with his masters. On these occasions he found his bed at midnight, and at 6 A. m. helped the Shorthorns to their food with Baldwin. To this sterling character Herace became exceedingly attached, and, if his youthful failings must be confessed, he became even more attached to Dorcas, Baldwin’s pretty and very praiseworthy daughter. All’s well that ends well, still an escapade of this kind is not a thing to be concealed in a picture of village life, but rather to be portrayed on principle as a picture of manners not necessarily twenty years ago, and in some sense as a warning. In the story of Silas Marner, God fey Cass, the squire’s son, marries a village girl with unhappy consequences, such as usually follow an ill-assorted match, and such as Horace Cooper happily escaped. Dorcas Baldwin was as graceful a maiden as ever laid the cloth for dinner—a duty she was deftly performing one day when Horace, who had been watching her, as she very well knew, advanced from the bay window, where he.had been half-concealed by a stand of 'ferns,' and offered Dorcas a rose. The language of flowers is nearly dead, but even in this prosaic age cultured people sometimes avail themselves of the rose to aid them in the delicate diplomacy of expressing love. Prince Albert, the graceful introducer into England of the Christmas tree, offered the Queen arose to convey what he hardly dared express. In the last sentence of Lothair a rose is made once more the pledge of love. Horace, having a rose in his button-hole, offered it to Dorcas, who instantly turned her back upon him and sped out of the room. Instinct, according ta Falstaff, is a great matter. It taught him discretion at the battle of Shrewsbury; and it induced in Dorcas instant flight. Happily for the Compton people the seeds of emulation were scattered thick among them. Horace was continually stirring the cauldron in this respect. He took his turn in the great kitchen at Weston as a teacher of book learning, and he imparted lessons quite as useful when he stirred up the fanners, great and small, on the subject of stock management-—his special forte. He was the whetstone of the parish, the sharpener of wits. Mrs fhornback, herself, listened to him on dairy topics ; : there; was no second-rate butter made in Compton, the presence of the whetstone preventing it; and even young Thofnback, and the other small farmers, learned the art of feeding beef at . 20 months, and. piled up little fortunes by the practice of high farming skilfully conducted. Baldwin, the bailiff, and the father of Dorcas, lived at an offhand farm, in a house. with cultivated fields behind on the higher ground, and the meadows and village below. The trout stream ran purling near ; and on the shelving slopes of the little valley there were steep pastures, an apple orchard, a sheltering copse, and some noble beech trees—which were retained on that conspicuous site for the ornament they offered. To this pleasant trysting place the village gathered on Sundays, and here most of the love matches of the rustics were arranged. It was June, and the sweetest hour of a Mid-summer day, when, towards dusk, the birds were still sinking; sheep were nibbling around the beeches, and rinsrdoves were cooing among their branches. Dorcas had been at her mother’s, and had found a companion for the short walk home. Horace had not sought the position, but there he was at her side. That young fellow was possessed by ambition of the better kind beyond his opportunities of culture. He desired with all his soul to follow noble men, hut felt the difficulty of obtaining models in the district where he lived. Plutarch’s great men, with whom he oft consorted, were not like living models. Lately he had read Jane Eyre and become familiar with the interesting Rochester. Byron, too, had suffused his mind with sweet, moody, and luxurious melody. He had lived in the romantic society of Lara, the Corsair, and Gulnare, and with too attractive ' c beauty of the Cyclades,” He often read beneath the beech trees, and seeing Dorcas passing he waved her a greeting and came to her side. At the attempted presentation of the rose, as we have seen Dorcas had bolted, and Horace had offered no more roses ; but he looked at her often and spoke to her frequently. He was a friendly fellow and a favorite with Dorcas, who could look in his face generally without blushing —always when others were present. They strolled home together across the bridge and so up to the ivied porch of Weston. He preferred Dorcas to all the Greek girls hs had read of in Plutarch— Lais, Thais, Helen—all. Mr Harold Goodhope was extremely fond of angling, fond in fact of any kind of sport, froni the hunting of the fox down to worrying the rat, and more particularly fond of angling in June when the vacation at his military college commenced. The young cadet had arrived at Compton for his usual holiday; and he and Horace, being both active lads, with legs of the same thickness (a Shaksperian reason for friendship between young men), were fre quent companions, fishing, or strolling round the copse with their guns, shooting young, half-grown rabbits. They were coming up through the copse between Baldwin’s house and the “ bridge of sighs,” when they met Dorcas, who droopped a little curtsey. “By Jove!” exclaimed the squire’s son, “ did you notice that girl?"" and he looked back. “By Jove! she’s looking back,” said the squire’s sou ; and he stopped and uttered some more “By Joves!” still looking back. “ Suppose we give chase,” said the squire’s son. Horace’s face turned red with a sudden conflagration • that threatened to scorch the down upon his cheek and lip. His friend whistled with a peculiar whistle, and begged his pardon in a tone of voice that set Horace thinking after he got home. Long and deeply he reflected. He remem bered the rejection of the rose and the pro gress of their acquaintance since, ever pro gressing as it was—whether towards the sad or silly ? Searching for reasons, and hunting up the pros and cons of his conduct and of hers, the sound-hearted, honest youth, asked himself why he had offered Dorcas the rose, why she had refused it, and whether he vyould like to offer one in Mrs Lambert’s presence. We shall not analyse his mental movements ; suffice it to say he, offered Dorcas no more roses, nor sly tributes of any kind. Others did and she accepted them. The word ""“others” here means, one person, ■and no more. Her one and all, and all in all, stands at her side at Weston, in a dairy —a cool place for love-making as it is con ducted generally in works of fiction; but then our story is not fiction, but a truth ful narrative, where every incident is derived from the memory of the narrator, not from his imagination. The swains ot the village are sincere in love ; the maidens lack not sentiment, but they are not senti mental. That “ emptier name” of love, “ the modern fair one’s jest,” is not the love of villages, where Cupid blows the torch of Hymen, and “many waters can not quench” the flame. He stands beside her in the dairy, with a bucket in his hand. Mrs Lambert is skimming off the cream, Dorcas and her friend both being attendant. ‘‘ls that you, Aa.ron,? ; Mrs Lambert asked that question with a,half-abstracted air, and continued her skimminq. ..There, was no doubt about: the fact. Aaron Motte, lithe and well-knit as : any lad in Compton, or as .the statues of the youth ful David,, was.a parson of some presence. The loose ends of our story must now be gathered together as rapidly as possible. To elaborate would be a work of'three volumes. The story of William Root’s son who married Mrs Frost’s dairymaid, and began life with a cow three years after the succession of the Goodhope dynasty, might be spread over many pages. Other matches of the same prudent kind were arranged. The best young men in Comp ton showed preference for dairymaids, and the best bred girls, finding a better choice of husbands than of old, looked out for sobriety. Nunquam non par aims, always ready— at no time not prepared-—should be the motto of the marriageable youth of the rustic class, and the state of preparedness should include skill in domestic economy on the female side, and L3O or L4O saved on the male. The demand for the cow pastures was active, and the habit of thrift was induced by the success of neighbors,, and by the knowledge of fresh pastures for occupation by those who cared to claim them. Both Aaron Motte and Dorcas saved up for cow keeping. When the steam cultivator ar rived at Weston, Aaron, at nineteen, proved by far the best man for the work of organ ising in the field. He rode the cultivator and set out the work, undisputed master in the master’s absence, by virtue of superior tact and talent. He became as eminent a stock-feeder as Mr Baldwin himself. At the evening classes at Weston, under the special care of Horace, he had learned to read and write, arts which he had almost forgotten at the time when he and Comp ton generally were drifting to the bad under the old regime. The father of Aaron Motte, the gardener whom we saw in the Dew Drop iuu, was another of the men who prospered. The two friends, he and the hook-nosed Sam, were observed one day paddling in the trout stream. They were levelling and planting watercresses. Their first crops were carried to the market town for Lon don. Then the railway came, and the station, as Mr Goodhope had predicted ; and in a tew years the watercress beds had extended to 10 acres, planted in shallow ponds, level as a billiard table, and flooded from the trout.stream, and Mr Motte and hook-nosed Sam, who married and re married his partner’s daughter, became the owners of a capital which gradually swelled to several thousand pounds ; and the smart girl beca ne a jolly, industrious matron, and rode to market in a four wheeled chaise. The farming throughout the estate ms quite first-rate, and the farmers prospered by good management, under that branch, of the management which secured good pay to those who earned it. Mr Good hope and his tenants were before the age, but the time will come when both masters and men will recognise in a mutual and concurrent prosperity, a sounder system than the present ; and when landlords will find in the practice of, what we will call parochial patriotism, the best security for their rents.",Fiction

Sib, —I observe in the “ Southland Times ” of September 24th another letter from “ Elector of Wallace,” professing to be a rejoinder to mine of 30th ultimo which appeared in your columns. He says, “ Beyond a bare doubt of rny facts he docs not attempt refutation.” Surely, Sir, the gentleman does not know what refutation means. He gives his own estimate of the agri cultural land in and around that district. I am undoubtedly opposed to his estimate, but will take those of several gentlemen who had been commissioned to examine and report on the same tlvng. I observe at the same time that their uncon nected reports tallied exactly. But their esti mates differ so materially from his,that there must be refutation somewhere ; either he refutes them or they refute him. But he objects that I got my figures in a blue book. What about that! If the figures are correct, what matters it whether the book was blue or tartan? Besides, if I did nothing beyond denying the truth of his statements, where would I find a blue book that does that? He keeps always repeating, “If the land is there, define its locality.” Sir, what am I to make of a gentleman (no, I am wrong in using such a word,- say rather a traitor to his home) like this. Sir, I never spoke of a single acre of which I did not define the locahtv. Must I set him down on every separate acre and make him count them one by one. Then “ Mr Theophilus Daniel says if there is no land for ploughing there is plenty of coal.” Oh ! w.lut a sly way of putting it. I said there was plenty of coal, but when or where did I say that r.kere was no land for ploughing ? That taotio won’i pass muster. But it seems by his statement that the gas engineer at Invercargill has said “ the Orepuki shale is worthless.” Nothing more than can bo expected from that quarter. The Nightcaps coalfield can no doubt supply them I truly wish it may ; but the thing is, find it first there, and then if it is a superior sort to ours, ex isting in larger quantities, then by all means give it the pieferenoo —I much doubt it. Now, Sir, I should very much like to know if these are the exact words used by the engineer, because if it is only “ Elector's ” gloss on his words it is useless. At anyrate, lie might have given the name of the engineer ho means, or whether he lives in “ Tuy or Dee street, Invercargill.” I happen to know the Engineer at Dunedin holds a very different opinion, and wo have the published opinions of Captain Hutton and l . Professor Black, who both speak very highly indeed of this coal. “ Elector ” tines not like “parliamentary” reports..” Pro fessor Black was on the ground and took a sample, which he subjected to a chemuai anuly is with very line results. Captain Hu'ton dis'inetly says that it is better Limn the coal at the Night caps, and private parties have every now and then puVlished the results of their private ex periments, and I have never heard an unfavour able report before. “ Elector ” next indulges in a rigmarole story about levying “ black mail ” for the benefit of the diggers at Orepuki, for although he does not use the words quoted ho describes the thing. Tins, I humbly submit, is gross impertinence, and as -uch I dismiss it. He says “certain parties have exiled themselves to an all but inaccessible re gion.” I cannot realise the idea that a region possessing the raw materials of so many indus tries, and which can be reached by a railroad of fifteen miles length, and with few engineering difficulties, should be considered inaccessible. In conclusion, he challenges an appeal to figures as to land and traffic. Q-ood Heavens I he has already got the figures as to the land, As to the traffic, the appeal for the railway is not grounded on the present, but the probable, nay to some extent the certain future. How could any of the industries I indicated have even a beginning when there is sometimes lacking the means of transit for the bare necessities of life. —I am, l&c., Theophilus Daniel.

"" The man who forged the promissory mote."" ""Oh, Mr. Burt!"" ""The same man that forged the news paper extracts to deceive you, forged the ""promissory note years ago, and the man who is setting spies on you is the man who forged those extracts ; so we are sure to :nail him.

When you go back, the other spies will be so frightened, they will go off to their em ployer, and so we shall nail him."" Helen complied with these instructions •strictly, and then returned home, leaving Mr. Burt to work. She had been home abont half-an-hour, when the servant brought her up a message, saying that a man wanted to speak to her. ""Admit him,"" said Helen. "" He is dressed very poor, miss."" "" Never mind ; send him to me."" She was afraid to reject anybody now, ""Jest she might turn her back on infor mation. A man presented himself in well-worn ■ clothes, with a wash-leather face and close ; shaven chin ; a little of his forehead was . also shaven. "" Madam, my name is Hand."" Helen started. ""I have already had the honor of writing to you."" ""Yes, sir,"" said Helen, eyeing him with ■ fear and aversion. ""Madam, I am come"" — (he hesitated). •""lam an unfortunate man. Weighed . down by remorse for a thoughtless act that has ruined an innocent man, and nearly . cost my worthy employer his life, I come to expiate as far as in me lies. But let me be brief, and hurry over the tale of . shame. I was a clerk at Wardlaw's office. A bill-broker called Adams, was talking tto me and my fellow clerks, and boasting . that . nobody could take him in with a feigned signature. Bets were laid ; our •vanity was irritated by his pretension. It ■ was ray fortune to overhear my young master and his friend Robert Penfold / speak about a loan of two thousand pounds. In an evil hour I listened to the tempter, .and- wrote a forged note for that amount. I took it to Mr. Penfold ; he presented it io Adams, and it was cashed. I intended, -of course, to call next day, and tell Mr. Penfold, and take him to Adams, and .restore the money, and get back the note. It was. not due for three months. Alas ! <that very day it fell under suspicion. Mr. .{Penfold was arrested. My young master ' -was -struck down with illness at his friend's guilt,. though he never could be quite got ito believe it; and I, miserable coward, dared not tell the truth. Ever since that fday I have been a miserable man. The -other day I came into money, and left Wardlaw's service. But I carry my re dnorse with me. Madam, I am come to ftell the truth. I dare not tell it to Mr. Wardlaw ; I think he would kill me. But I will tell it to you, and you can tell it to him ; ay, tell it to all the world. 'Let my shame be as public as his whom I have injured so deeply ; but, Heaven .knows, unintentionally. I — I — I "" Mr. Hand sank all in a heap where he •sat, and could say no more. Helen's flesh crawled at this confession, .and at the sight of this reptile, who owned that he had destroyed Robert Penfold in fear and cowardice. For a long time her wrath so overpowered all sense of pity, •that she sat trembling ; and if eyes could kill, Mr. Hand would not have outlived his confession. At last she contrived to speak. She turned her head away not to see the wretch, and said, sternly, — ""Are yon prepared to make this state ment on paper, if called on ?"" Mr. Hand hesitated, but said "" Yes."" "" Then write down that Robert Penfold was innocent, and you are ready to prove it whenever you may be called upon."" ""Write that down ?"" said Hand. "" Unless your penitence is feigned, you will."" "" Sooner than that should be added to my crime, I will avow all."" He then wrote the few lines she re quired. "" Now your address, that I may know where to find you at a moment's notice."" He then wrote ""J. Hand, 11, War wick-street, Pimlico."" Helen then dismissed him, and wept bitterly. In that condition she was found by Arthur Wardlaw, who comforted her, and on hearing her report of Hand's con fession, burst out into triumph, and re minded her he had always said Robert Penfold was innocent. ""My father,"" said he, "" must yield to this evidence, and we will lay it before the Secretary of State, and get his pardon."" ""His pardon ! when he is innocent."" ""Oh, that is the form ; the only form. The rest must be done by the warm re ception of his friends. I, for one, who all these years have maintained his innocence, will be the first to welcome him to my house, an honored guest. What am 1 saying ? Can I ? dare I ? ought I ? when my wife Ah ! I am more to be pitied than my poor friend is ; my friend, my rival. Well, I leave it to you whether he can come into your husband's house."" ""Never."" "" Bnt, at least, I can send the ' Spring bok' out, and bring him home ; aud that I will do without one day's delay."" "" Oh, Arthur !"" cried Helen, "" you set me au example of unselfishness."" ""I do what I can,"" said Arthur. ""I am no saint. I hope for a reward."" Helen sighed. "" What shall Ido ?"" "" Have pity on me ! your faithful lover, and to whom your faith was plighted be fore ever you saw or knew my unhappy friend. What can Ido or suffer more than I have done and suffered for you ? My sweet Helen, have pity on me, and be my wife."" "" I will ; some day."" ""Bless you; bless you. One effort more : what day ?"" ""I can't ; I can't. My heart is dead."" "" This day fortnight. Let me speak to your father : let him name the day."" As she made no reply, he kissed her hand devotedly, and did speak to her father. Sir Edward, meaning all for the best, I said, "" This day fortnight."" CHAPTER LXIX. The next morning came the firstwedding presents from the jubilant bridegroom, who was determined to advance step by step and give no breathing time. When Helen saw them laid out by her maid, she trembled at the consequences of not giving a plump negative to so brisk a wooer. The second post brought two letters ; one of them from Mrs. Undercliff. The other contained no words, but only a pearl of uncommon size and pear-shaped. Helen received this at first as another wedding present, and an attempt on Arthur's part to give her a pearl as large as those she had gathered on her dear island. But, looking narrowly at the address, she saw it was not written by Arthur ; and presently she was struck by the likeness of this peai'l in shape to some of her own. She got out her pearls, laid them side by side, and began to be moved exceedingly. She had one of her instincts, and it set every fibre quivering with ex citement. It was some time before she could take her eyes off the pearls, and it was with a trembling hand she opened Mrs. Undercliff's letter. It ran thus :—: — ""My Dear Young Ladt — A person called here last night, and supplied the clue. If you have the courage to know the truth, you have only to come here, and to bring your diary, and all the letters you have received from any person or persons since you landed in England. "" I am yours obediently, "" Jane Undercliff."" The courage to know the truth ! This mysterious sentence affected Helen considerably. But her faith in Robert was too great to be shaken. She would not wait for the canonical hour at which young ladies go out, but put on her bonnet directly after breakfast. Early as she was, a visitor came before she could start — Mr. Burt, the detective. She received him in the library. Mr. Burt looked at her dress and her little bag, and said, "" I'm very glad I made bold to call so early."" "" You have got information of import ance to communicate to me ?"" "" I think so, miss ;"" and he took out his note-book. "" The person you are watched by is Mr. Arthur Wardlaw."" The girl stared at him. "" Both spies report to him twice a day, at his house in Russell Square."" ""Be careful, Mr. Burt ; this is a serious thing to say, and may have serious conse quences."" "" Well, miss, you told me you wanted to know the truth."" ""Of course I want to know the truth."" "" Then the truth is that you are watched by order of Mr. Wardlaw."" Burt continued his report. "" A shabby-like man called on you yesterday."" "" Yes ; it was Mr. Hand, Mr. Wardlaw's clerk. A»d oh, Mr. Burt, that wretched creature came and confessed the truth. It was he who forged the note, out of sport, and for a bet, and then was too cowardly to own it."" She then detailed Hand's confession. ""His penitence comes too late,"" said she, with a deep sigh. ""It hasn't come yet,"" said Burt, drily. "" Of course my lambs followed the man. He went first to his employer, and then he went home. His name is not Hand. He is not a clerk at all, but a little actor at the Corinthian Saloon. Hand is in America : went three months ago. I ascertained that from another quarter."" "" Oh, goodness !"" cried Helen, "" what a wretched world ! I can't see my way a yard for stories."" "" How should you, miss ? It is clear enough for all that. Mr. Wardlaw hired this actor to pass for Hand, and tell you a lie, that he thought would please you."" Helen put her hand to her brow, and thought ; but her candid soul got sadly in the way of her brain. ""Mr. Burt,"" said she, ""will you go with me to Mr. Undercliff, the Expert ?"" ""With pleasure, ma'am ; but let me finish iry report. Last night there was something new. Your house was watched by six persons. Two were Wardlaw's, three were Burt's, but the odd man was there on his own hook ; and my men could not make him out at all ; but they think one of Wardlaw's men knew him, for he went off to Russell Square like the wind, and brought Mr. Wardlaw here in disguise. Now, miss, that is all ; and shall I call a cab, and we'll hear Undercliff's tale ?"" The cab was called, and they went to Undercliff. On the way Helen brooded ; but the detective eyed every man and everything on the road with the utmost keenness. Ed ward Underoliff was at work at ] lithographing. He received Helen cor dially, nodded to Burfc, and said she could not have a better assistant. He then laid his fac-simile of the forged note on the table, with John Wardlaw's genuine writing and Penfold's endorse ment. "" Look at that, Mr. Burt."" Burfc inspected the papers keenly. "" You know, Burt, I swore at Robert Penfold's trial that he never wrote that forged note."" "" I remember,"" said Burt. "" The other day this lady instructed me to discover, if I could, who did write the forged note ; but, unfortunately, the materials she gave me were not sufficient. But, last night, a young man dropped from the clouds, that I made sure was an agent of yours, Miss Rolleston. Under that im pression I was rather unguarded, and let him know how far we had got, and could get no farther. ' I think I can help you,' says this young man, and puts a letter on the table. Well, Mr. Burt, a glance at that letter was enough, for me. It was written by the man who forged the note."" ""A letter !"" said Helen. "" Yes. I'll put the letter by the side of the forged note, aud if you have any eye for writing at all, you'll see at once that one hand wrote the forged note and this letter. lam also prepared to swear that the letters signed Hand are forgeries by the same person."" He then coolly put upon the table the letter from Arthur Wavdlaw that Helen had received on boai'd the ' Proserpine,' and was proceeding to point out the many points of resemblance between the letter and the document, when he was inter rupted by a scream from Helen. ""Ah !"" she cried. ""He is here. Only one man in the world could have brought that letter. Ileftiton the island. Robert is here : he gave you that letter."" "" You are right,"" said the Expert ; "" and what a fool I must be. I have no eye except for handwriting. He had a beard : and such a beard !"" ""It is Robert !"" cried Helen, in rap tures. ""He is come just in time."" ""In time to be arrested,"" said Burt. ""Why, his time is not out. He'll get into trouble again."" ""Oh ! Heaven forbid !"" cried Helen, and turned so faint, she had to be laid back on a chair, and salts applied to her nostrils. She soon came to, and cried and trembled, but prepared to defend her Robert with all a woman's wit. Burt and Undercliff were conversing in a low voice, and Burt was saying be felt sure Wardlaw's spies had detected Robert Penfold, and that Robert would be arrested and put into prison as a runaway convict. "" Go to Scotland Yard this minute, Mr. Burt,"" said Helen, eagerly. "" What for ?"" ""Why, you must take the commission to arrest him. You are our friend."" Burt slapped his thigh with delight. ""That is first-rate, miss,"" said he; ""I'll take the real felon first, you may depend. Now, Mr. Undercliff, write your report, and hand it to Miss Helen with fac-similes. It will do no harm if you make a declaration to the same effect before a magistrate. You, Miss Rolleston, keep yourself dis engaged, and please don't go out. You will very likely hear from me again to-daj r ."" He drove off, and Helen, though still greatly agitated by Robert's danger, and the sense of his presence, now sat down, trembling a little, and compared Arthur's letter with the forged document. The effect of this comparison was irresistible. The Expert, however, asked her for some letter of Arthur's that had never passed through Robert Peufold's hands. She gave him the short note in which he used the very words, Robert Penfold. Ho said he would make that note the basis of his report. . -<■ While he was writing it, Mrs. Undercliff came in, and Helen told her all. She said, ""I came to the same conclusion long ago ; but when you said he was to be your husband "" "" Ah,"" said Helen, ""we women are poor creatures ; we can always find some reason for running away from the truth. Now explain about the pi*ayer-book."" ""Well, miss, I felt sure he would steal it, so I made Ned produce a fac-simile. And he did steal it. What you got back was your mother's prayer-book. Of course I took care of that."" "" Oh, Mrs. Undercliff,"" said Helen, ""do let me kiss you."" Then they had a nice little cry tog-ether, and by the time they had done, the report was ready in duplicate. "" I'll declare this before a magistrate,"" said the Expert, ""and then I'll send it you.""

Why law, honey, when I was a gal, if one of the fellows came along when I had my dress tucked np that way, and my head kivered with an old white rag, I would run for dear life and hide out of sight.

AT seven o'clock on the morning of the 20th October, 18—, the coach, winch at that date still furnished the means of communi cation between Liverpool aud London, deposited at its halting place in a court of the baracen a Head, two females eminently calculated to attract attention. Both young and remarkably handsome, their carriage and personal appear ance generally betrayed at a glance an origin undoubtedly foreign; one of them moreover, was of a type full of startling coutrasts. Her brow was of a purity almost angelic, her eyes were large, blue, and exquisitely sweet, but on her full and pouting lips passion stood confessed, whilst her clearly denned eye-brows, nearly meeting in the centre, revealed an indomitable will Her complexion approached that of a brunette, enriched with the rosy tints of youth, and masses of blue-black hair surrounded a face whose perfect oval might have been envied by the virgins of Perugino. It was evident that the warm rays of an Italian sun had left then impress on both her countenance and her mind. uleanor was, indeed, a Genoese, her com panion, a tall and hand ome brunette of shapely figure, an nglishwoman. The former hesitated to leave the conveyance, and seemed to await a friendly arm, but sud denly overcoming her hesitation, she made her way to the room where the arrival of the passengers was awaited by their friend--. She evidently did not find the person whom she expected to see there, for after a rapid survey of the room she hurried into the street. There, also, her scrutiny was futile, and with an air of thorough dissappointment, she rejoined her com panion, who by this time had descended from the coach, and was occupied in paying the fares. ""He is not there ! What can be the meaning of it?"" cried she on approchiug her. ""But 1 hear a carriage ; it must be he."" _ With petulant haste, in itself charming, she rushed towards a carriage then entering the court, but returned almost at once. "" -o "" she said in a tone of vexation, ""it is a gentleman, but oh ! so ugly. It is not my husband."" . ""Are you quite sure that he has received your letter?"" asked Mary. , ""Why not? I put it in the post myself at Liverpool before we left."" - ""Then Mr. Hardcastle must have overslept himself. Did he not say in one of his last letters that he had been obliged to discharge his servant, and was living alone."" '""-Yes, but do you think he could sleep while he was expecting me ? You don't know how he loves me,"" added she, with a bewitching smile which exposed to view her pearly teeth. All this was said with rapid haste, for Fleanor, with true southern vivacity, seized hap-hazard on any word wliich the other did not furnish quickly enough. "" What are we to do now ? said Eleanor at last. ""Call a cab, and make our way to your husband's apartments.' ""And suppose he crosses us?' "" We shall see him, or at all events they will tell him here that we have gone, and he will come after us "" "" Come, then,"" said Eleanor, looking round the court again in vain. The vehicle which had brought the ugly individual was on the point of leaving, and Mary hailed it. "" What is the matter with you ? "" she cried, as Eleanor sighed deeply on taking her seat. ' ' I am — I had pictured to myself so much joy in one more entering with him under that roof Avhere t have experienced such happiness since my marriage."" "" But, my dear mistress, you are going to rejoin him there. ' "" I do not know, I am afraid."" ""What an idea! Do you think he is ill? He never is. Besides, have you not had news of him within the last two days ?"" ""it is of no use, I am uneasy,"" Eleanor could not help saying, "" this cab is so slow ; we shall never get there. What need has the driver to choose Portland Street to reach St. John's Wood ? it is far too long."" ""He takes us for strangers,"" replied Mary, "" and he is artful enough to present London to us under its most seductive aspect."" Our two travellers, felt, perforce, all these impressions. Gazing from the windows of their cab they saw will all their eyes, and appreciated with all their heart. Eleanor forgot her ill-humour, and not a trace of uneasiness remaiued on her lovely countenance. But a short space separated her from him she so longed to see once more, hut a few minutes could elapse hefore she would take him by surprise at home. She even rejoiced that he had not met her. ""He never received my letter, and he does not expect me,"" said she. "" How happy he will he ! "" The blush of joy overspread her cheeks, her eyes sparkled, and she smiled on the passers-by, who stopped in admiration of her beauty. Suddenly, the cab quitted the main-street, and, entering St. John's Wood, stopped at the door of No. 6 i rcadia Road. Eleanor's first movement was to look up at the windows of the house. ""It is not open,"" she cried, ""the lazy fellow, he is asleep."" And, without paying any attention to her companion, but leaving her to settle with the driver and arrange about the luggage and all the miscellaneous articles with which the cab was laden, she burst open the door, leaped out, rushed past Avithout a word, ran up a flight of stairs, and pulled the bell with an eager hand. Some seconds elapsed, and the bell remained unanswered. She gave a second peal, and listened. Not a sound came from the room. "" I was right,"" she said to herself, ""he has. gone to meet me, and we have passed each other oa the road,"" "" Will you dear Mary go and see if he is at the coach office ?"" "" Yes,"" replied Mary, and a cab passing, she got into it. She had chanced on a remarkable one, for the horses broke at once into a gallop. fleanor resigned herself to wait, but she could not rest. She walked feverishly to and fro in the street, casting unceasing glances on the still darkened windows. As she looked intently at them she thought she could perceive that the blinds were down, so that complete darkness must reign in the room. Her husbao d, then, was not yet up. Very soon Mary returned. "" Well ? "" cried Eleanor to her. Mary replied l>y shaking her head. F.leanor then sent for a locksmith who tried the door, which to his great astonishment was not locked, and the door opened at the first attempt. Eleanor sprang into the room. She crossed the outer room, the dining-room, the drawing room ; everything was in its wonted state. She entered the bedroom, the door of which was wide open. All at once Mary heard a scream— a terrible scream. She ran toward the sound. In the middle of the room lay ileanor insensible. Close to the bed, half on the floor and half resting against the mattress, was stretched a corpse, covered with blood — the body of a man assassinated — and on an open memorandum book, such as is used by men on the Exchange, were these Avords, written in blood — ""i-leanor, avenge me— the assassin's name — "" Death had laid his icy grasp on the hand of the victim at the moment when he was about to write the name of his murderer.

Hoppleboffer dropped the paper and went to musing on the golden past. Visions of beauty flitted before him and made him sigh that the wheels of time should whirl so rapidly. Once more he was a young man. One by one the buried years were resur rected, and the joys and sorrows of each were dwelt upon. He was trying to remember the last time he had told his wife that he loved her. He would turn over a new leaf and make his wife's heart bound with joy. He would tell her that she was dear to him, and watch the roses bloom in her cheek again. The thought was delicious, and made him feel as though he had money in every pocket. Let us see how the old man prospered in his undertaking, When Hoppleboffer got home his wife had just been having a noisy matinee with the servant about something that hadn't been done to suit her, and she was just about mad enough to leave the prints of her teeth in cold iron. She bounded into the sitting-room just as he entered and threw herself into a chair with an emphasis that made the windows rattle, and broke a spring in the upholstery. Hoppleboffer was to much taken up with his new idea to notice her excitement, po he walked up to her side, chucked her under the chin, and, as he stooped to kiss her, said quite tenderly : "" My dear, I love you."" •'Simon Henry,"" said she, ""don't be a fool 1"" '• But my dear "" "" Don't you dare to dear me.

Shortly after I arrived here, I entered into the matter with all my power, but after innumerable failures, and a constant ex penditure of money, time and labor, which would have made any one exfcept an Englishman despair.

I milk two cowi, and have weighed the day's milk from them, which is as follows:—No. 1. 83lbs, and No. 2, 281bs at morning ; -and No. 1, 251bs, and No. 2,20 lbs, at evening ; which, at eleven pounds to the gallon, would be four pounds short oi ten gallons, returning, at three pence per gallon, about 2/4 per day, or 16/4 per week. Last week the same two cojvs made eighteen pounds of butter, the market price of which is ./6 to -/9, showing a difference of 7/4 per week on two cows, or 3/8 per cow. I think, Sir, this should be a clear proof of what great benefit a Dairy Factory will be to this district, and why some of our settlers, that are milking a large number of cows, should stand back, as it were, and not offer to support the Factory seems strange indeed; I have not the slightest doubt when it is an established fact they will be only too glad to send their milk in, for, as shown above, on twenty cows tbe profits would be over £3 per week \a hard pash, whiph js a good margin to pome and go on. When we con aider that with cash in hand you can get goods for 20 per cent less than when taking out your butter account at a store I think that alone should be » great inducement for everyone to give their fullest support to the pro posed Factory.

Now this Patizithes had a brother whose name was Smerdis, the name of that brother of Cambyses whom he had sent Prexaspes all the way from Egypt to Porsia to assassinate. Patizithes therefore conceived the project of raising his own brother, Smerdis, to the throne of Media and Persia, under pre tence that he was the other Smerdis, brother of Cambyaes— a thing that was. not difficult to do, because very few of the Persians knew anything of the murder which Prexaspes had committed, and therefore the nation was pre pared to look upon the pretender as the true Prince Smerdis, son of Cyrus, and brother of Cambyses. Patizithes thereupon sent heralds through all the land of Persia and even to Ecbatana, where Cambyses lay with his army on his way home from Egypt, to proclaim that Cambyses no longer reigned over Persia, but that his brother Smerdis was in future to be obeyed as king. When Cambyses heard this bold proclama tion of the herald, he at once concluded that this was the real Smerdis, his own brother, and consequently that Prexaspos, whom lie had sent to commit the murder, had played him false. He accordingly ordered Prexaspes to be galled"" before him. "" Proxaspes,"" said he, "" did you despatch the business on which I sont you lately ? "" "" O king !"" replied Prexaspes, ""there is no truth in the report that your brother Smerdie has rebelled against you. How could that bo when I myself executed your commands, and buried him with my own hands ? If tho dead cau come back to life then you have cause to fear Smerdis, but not unless. Let us pursue the herald and bring him back : then wo can inquire by whom he was commissioned to pro claim Smerdis king."" Cambyses, thinking this excellent advice, sent messengers in pursuit of the herald, who brought him back to the king's presence, and then Prexaspes questioned him as to whether it was Smerdis himself or gome ono of his Ministers who had ordered him to make his proclamation. The herald thereupon confessed that he had not so much as seen Smerdis since tho time when Cambyses set out ,f<>r Egypt, and that it was the steward of the palace, who had ordered him to make the proclamation. Then said Cambyses : "" 1 see, Prexaspes, that you have acted like a faithful man, and tarried out my instruc tions. But who can this Persian ba who has revolted against mo, and usurped the name of Sinerdis ? "" ""I see through the whole plot, your Ma jesty,"" replied Prexaspes ; ""it is Patizithes who has revolted against you, and set his bro ther Smerdis on the throne."" Then it flashed on Cambyses what a fool he had _ been : _ how, because someone announced to him in his sleep that Smerdis was seated on a royal throne and touched the heavens, lie had committed the dreadful ciime of fratri cide. And this crime all for nothing ! for, it was another Smerdis that was meant. Then Cambyses wept for the death of his brother Smerdis, for those Oriental villains seem to have had extremely tender feelings, to judge by the ease with which they shed tears. After a becoming amount of weeping and swearing Cambyses leapt on his horse, deter mined to go to Susa with all speed and punish the presumptuous usur-per. In the act of leaping on his horse, however, the scabbard of hia aword fell off, and the bare blade struck Cambyses and wounded him in the thigh — just on the spot where he had himself wounded the god Apis, so unsafe a thing is it to trifle with the gods. Feeling himself to bo mortally wounded, he inquired what was the name of the city where they then were. They told him it was Eeba fcana. When he knew that there was indeed no hope for him.'for an oracle had told him that he should end his life at Ecbatana, his misfortunes brought him back to his right mind, and he said to those who stood round him : "" Here it is fated that Cambyses, son of Cyrus,- should die."" Abut three weeks after receiving his wound Cambyses called the principal men of the Per sian Court round him, and made to them his dying confession. He told them of -the dream he had had about Sinerdis touching the heavens with his head, and of tho subsequent assassination of that prince. Ho bitterly lamented that after going to the exppnse and trouble of having committed a draadtui crime it should all have profited him nothing, since he had cut off tho very man who should have avenged the injury done him by this usurper. Then he'adjured them by all they held sacred and by their hopes of prosperity not to let those Median impostors retain possession of tho kingdom ; if"" they did, he hoped that speedy perdition might catch their souls. And having uttered those pious and patriotic senti ments, the royal madman and ruffian died. The Persian courtiers, when they saw their king in such penitent and desperate mood, as in duty bound, wept profusely, and howled out their lamentations, and rent the garments they had ou, which let us hope were not their best. But as soon as they were sure the king was quite dead, they looked at each other, and nodded their heads, and winked, and said it was all their eye and Beate Martine. They did not believe a word the king had said about the assassination of Smerdis, thinking it was a cock-and-bull story of the king's own, specially invonted to set the minds of the Persians against his brother Smerdis. They confidently believed that it was the son of Cyrus that had seized the kingdom, and no impostor. And they were confirmed in this belief when they heard Prexaspes vehemently deny having put Prince Srcevdis to death ; for Prexaepes caw that it would be very unsafe for him to ac knowledge, now that Cambyses was dead, that he had dared to put a son of Cyrus to death with his own hand. Now the false Smerdis,' after the death of Cambyses, reigned peacefully on the throne of Persia for the space of seven months, during which time he treated his subjects so indul gently that all tho tributary States of the Empire regretted him exceedingly when ho died. He sent mossengers through all parts of the Empire, immediately on ascending the throne, to proclaim that for tho space of three years no taxes would bo collected ami no one should have to servo as a soldier, both of which privileges must have been very acceptable to people ground down with taxation and harassed with military service. But at the end of seven months Smerdis was discovered to be the impostor that he was — in the following manner. But I think I must reserve the manner of his discovery for another Yarn.",Fiction

"" It isfoolish to look at things that worry yoa,"" she paid, ""but this letter was left by my poor father."" Sir Kalph's clonded brow instantly cleared. ""Ah, by your father,"" he said, in a relieved tone. ""lam so vexed I intruded on you — and about suoh nonsense too."" "" And what is the nonsense ? "" asked Laura. "" But will you not sit down 1 "" There was a good fire burning in the grate, and at either side of the hearthrug two basket chairs stood empty. Sir Ralph looked at one of these, and laid his hand on the back of it. "" May I sib here for a few minutes 1 "" he asked. "" Yes, do,"" and then Laura sat down oppo site to him. "" I'm afraid what I have got to say will be rather a nuisance to you,"" continued Sir Ralph, stretching out his long legs before the ruddy glow of the fire with a sense of inward satisfaction ; "" but there are two girls in this houae I know — that I have known for some years — and as I left you I encountered one of them in the ball."" "" I heard that there were two young ladies here."" "" Yes, the two Mays ; they are the nieces of my old tutor, Mr Phillips, who was vicar of Laytonside, and these girls are ADglo- Imlianp, and lived with their aunt. I saw them sometimes, and Miss Patty is rather a gushing young person, and when she heard I knew you she insisted that she would call on you and make your acquaintance ; so I came lo warn you."" And Sir Ralph laughed. "" It is very kind,"" said Laura, with a faint uneasiness in her tone; ""but I fear I hava no time to make new acquaintances."" "" Then ju'ot tell the maid to say you are not at home. "" That would be rather uncourteous, would it not ? "" "" She had no right to propose such a thing, but Miss Patty is by no means shy."" "" She may not really come."" "" Perhaps not, bus I thought I would tell you. Their uncle was a nice old man ; my place, you know, is nob far from Laytonside, and when I was a l,?d I u<*ed to ride to the vicarage eveiy day."" ""Then you have known these young ladies a long time."" ""Oh, not so long as that — about three years, I think. Their father was a colonel out in India, and he died, and that is how they came to live with their aunt, Mrs Philips."" "" And are they preUy girls ? "" "" They are good-looking, I think."" "" And you are not sure ? "" smiled Laura. ""Not quite sure,"" answered Sir Ralph, also smiling. "" I used to think Patty rather pretty, but one's ideas change, I think."" "" Well, I shall tell you what I think when I see her."" "" She's a showy sort of girl, with golden hair ; but I hope they won't bore you."" "" Perhaps she will do for a model, a study,'' said Laura, still smiling. '• Do you mean for literature, or art 1 "" ""Oh, the study of a head; the golden hair you talk of is always artistic."" "" Miss Patty is very artistic, I shonld say,"" said Sir Ralph, with a somewhat grim little laugh. Then he added, "" But I suppose I should go now, only it's so comfortable here I do not feel inclined to move."" "" There is no hurry."" ""Am I not keeping you from your work ? "" "" No, it's too dark to work. Would yon like some tea ? "" "" I should most awfully."" Laura put one her band and rang the bell, and Sir Ralph breathed a sigh of inward satisfaction. He was not at all fond of tea, but it gave him an excuse to stay a quarter of an hour or so loi-ger with Laura, and he would have drunk many cups of tea for this pleasure. So the tea was brought in, and Laura poured it out, and Sir Ralph sat watching her by the flickering firelight. Laura was graceful, but she had none of the sensuous grace that distinguished Patty May. She moved with a certain dignity of bearing, and made no effort, and indeed never thought of attracting admiration. She was simple and natural alike in her words and manner, and all this Sir Ralph had been quick to per ceive. ""What a difference there is between them,"" he was thinking, comparing in his mental vision the two girls he knew under the same roof ; "" the one upstairs frightens me, but with Miss Ingram I feel at home."" So much at home, indeed, did he feel that he sat talking to Laura what he knew was an unreasonable time. Then suddenly he sprang up. "" I am ashamed of myself,"" he said ; 11 here I've been sitting wasting your time, and I dare say you have been wishing me away a thousand times."" "" No, I have not,"" answered Laura, pleasantly. "" I have enjoyed your conver sation."" ""Then I may come again?"" asked Sir Ralph, holding out his hand. "" Yes,"" answered Laura as she took it. So they parted, and Sir Ralph went out into the now-lighted streets with a new sense of elation and pleasure in his heart. Laura was such a charming companion, he told himself; so well-read, so thoughtful. Not always thinking of her handsome face, though it was a hundred times handsomer than Patty May's. He was sorry Patty was in the same house, but what did it matter ? Patty had nothing particular to tell against him. "" And she's not one to listen to idle gossip or insinuations,"" thought Sir Ralph ; "" she's a dear girl ; it makes a man feel better to have known her."" At this moment Miss Patty May was re ceiving what to her was almost a shock. The maid of the house, whose name was Brice, and who was of a talkative and lively dis position, was engaged in removing the after noon tea which had been ordered for Sir Ralph, but which he had declined to partake of. And as she was placing the cups on the tray, she remarked casually : "" The gentleman who called here had tea with Miss Ingram downstairs, miss."" "" What ? "" paid Patty, looking quickly up, who was leaning back in an easy chair by the fire, with a novel lying on her lap. "" Not Sir Ralph ? "" "" Yes"", mies, he was called Sir Ralph some thing, but I have forgot the rest; but be called on Miss Ingram first this afternoon, then on you, and after he left you he went again to Miss Ingrain's room, and they had tea together ; he's just gone."" A pang shot through Patty's vain heart ; an absolute pang of pain. He had declined to stay and have tea with her, and yet he had gone to this other girl ! ""Are you sure?"" she 3aid; ""Sir Ralph Woodland is an old friend of ours."" "" Yes, miss, I am quite sure, for I took in the tray. They were sitting together by the fire when I went in."" Patty asked no more questions ; she turned almost faint. She had set her heart on marrying Sir Ralph Woodland, and if this other girl had already come between she felt itwas more than she could bear. She looked at Ella, who was lying on a couch, and Ella gave an answerirjg glance. Then when Brice and her tea tray were gone, she rose from her seat and said hastily : "" What do you think of that, Ella ? "" "" It looked rather queer,"" answered Ella. "" What can she be to him ? "" went on Patty excitedly. "" She's an artist, he said, and a writer. Fancy Ralph Woodland carrying on a flirtation with a blue stocking ! What shall we do ; I must stop it some how 1 "" ""It may not be a flirtation,"" suggested Ella. "" It may not, but he would not stay to have tea here, and he went back you gee to her 1 I think,"" and Patty stamped one of her pretty feet vehemently on the floor, "" I could kill her if she takes him away from me!"" ""Don't be silly, Patty."" "" That's what I feel, I can tell you. lam certain he csrsd for me at one time, cared for me awfully; and to think that anyone should come between us would just drive me mad. We must get to know her at once, Ella, and see what sort of girl she is. I wonder if she is a3 good-looking as I am."" She went up to the mirror on the over mantel as she spoke, and stood there look icg at her pretty face. It was a fair image, and Patty's eyes did not recognise or see its faults. She believed in her own beauty, and was proud of it,, and she felt as she gazed at herself that she would win Sir Ralph still. "" She shall Hot cut me out,"" she said at length, turning away "" Let us call on her to-morrow, Ella. I told Ralph Woodland we would call."" ""Do you think you would until you know more about her ? "" suggested Ella. "" I do not care who she is, or what she is, as long as I stop her affair with Sir Ralph,"" answered Patty recklessly. "" Yes, we must go, Ella, and I'il try to get out from her how she got to know him, and how long she has known him, and all about it."" Accordirgly the next afternoon Patty and Ella May, having arranged themselves in their most becoming costumes, and having learnt from the maid Brice that Miss Ingram was at home, proceeded downstairs, and told Brice to rap at the door of Miss Ingram's room and take in their cards. This Brice did, and Patty then heard a sweet-toned voice say, ""Show the youug ladies In, Brice,"" which the maid at once pro ceeded to do. ■]$} Then Patty and Ella and Lanra Ingram rose to receive them, and bowed gravely. ""Excuse us for coming,"" said Patty, ad vancing smilingly; "" but a very great and a very old friend of ours told us all about you, and I think you know him also — Sir Ralph Woodland 1"" ""Yes, I know Sir Ralph Woodland,"" answered Laura, looking somewhat curiously at the two pretty girls before her. And the two pretty girls—one of them at least— was looking most critically at her. And Patty was too shrewd, too clever, not to admit that the slender black-robed woman before her, with her handsome face 'and noble bearing-, was net a dangerous rival. Pdtfcy recognised this at once, but she made no sign of any sach feeling. She looked in the most friendly manner at Laura ; she smiled her sweetest smiles. "" Sir Ralph told us you are a writer and a painter,"" she said, "" and I was so interested. It must be charming to be clever, and as we are in the same house, and all girls, we took the liberty of calling."" ""I am very pleased to see you,"" answered Laura, courteously. "" Where will you sit 1 "" Patty having placed herself in a graceful attitude on a chair, commenced again to talk of Sir Ralph Woodland. ""It was so odd,""' she said ; "" but I met Sir Ralph yesterday afternoon just coming out of your room. He is a very old friendindeed of ours,"" and here Patty cast down her eyes. ""He was a pupil of my poor uncle's, you know, the vicar of Laytonside, when he was a youth. Of course we were children then. Have you known him long ? "" "" Not very long,"" answered Laura with a half smile. She was beginning to percei^« the cause of Miss Patty May's visit from the drift of her conversation. ""Do tell me what you write?"" went on the voluble Patty. "" Are they love stories 1 "" "" There must be some love in all stories, you know,"" replied Laura with a little laugh. "" Can you lend me one ? I am dying to read it."" "" I am sorry I cannot, as I have had none published yet, but I have had one accepted, and then I shall be glad to lend it to you."" "" Oh ! how delightful ! Thank you so much. And Sir Ralph said you paint too. Is this one of yours ? "" And Patty rose, and went up to an easel in the corner of the room, on which there was an unfinished study of a girl's head. ""Yes,"" said Laura, following her, and looking at her work ; "" but as you see, this is in a very crude stace."" "" Still, I see it will be lovely when it is done. How clever you are ! Ah, I wish I was clever."" Patty rattled on in this fashion for at least half an hour longer, Ella chiming in occa sionally, and then the two rose to go, Patty warmly pressing Laura to return their visit early. Then as the door closed behind the sisters, they looked at each other signifi cantly, and Patty's expression was not a very happy one, and as soon as they reached their own room, she eaid quickly : "" What do you think of her, Ella ? "" "" She is good-looking ; almost handsome for a dark girl,"" replied Ella. "" Yes,"" admitted Patty, unwillingly. "" Bat she wants something — I don't think that Ralph Woodland can really admire her."" "" She did not say much about him."" ""Oh ! I think nothing of that, that might be just slyness ; and she looks one of those sly creatures who keep everything to them selves. Of course she'll try to make up to him — a girl working for her bread, I suppose, and liviDg in a back room. But we'll see."" And Patty nodded her golden head, and again went to the mirror and arranged her pretty bonnet more to her satisfaction be fore going out into the streets. The evening did not pass, however, before Laura Ingram was again reminded of her neighbours. This time the communication came in the form of a little note from Patty May, and was as follows : — Dear Miss Ingram,— Wonld yon very kindly (if you have it) give me Sir Ralph Woodland's address in town ? Was it not stnpid of us, bub though he left his card yesterday, we have con trived to mislay it, and I wish to ask him to come and have tea with us to-morrow, and I hope you will come also. Do come. — Yours sincerely, P 'atbicia May, Laura replied by giving Sir Ralph's ad dress at his club, and also accepted the invi tation to tea. She felt a little curious about these two girls, and their evident interest in Sir Ralph excited hers. "" She is handsome, the eldesfi one,"" she thought ; ""at least she has a sort of capiti vation about her. I wonder if he admires her."" And Liura sigbed.",Fiction

Pierre Savon, the barber, and Juques Mcnuble the miller, came ip -to smoke their evening pipes with host Baptiste, as their custom was. To them was related the story of the new guest—how he came, riding as if for the Hie of him; how giddily he descended from his horse ; how he abused Baptiste, and ordered him right and left; what an extraordinary name he had ; how quickly he started into colour at the mention of it, * And now,’ said Baptiste, ‘I have but just left him, and the moment I was outside the door, he turned (he key with a violent hand, and locked himself in. ‘ Bon soir, monsieur,’ said I. ‘ Bon diable !’ quoth he, enraged e’en at civility. ""‘Trictrac I I warrant ho is of my calling—a brave miller !’ said Jacques Menuble, laughing at his own joke. ‘ Take care what yon are about, host Baptiste,’ chirped Pierre Savon, shaking his little head mysteriously ; ‘ this looks mighty suspicions ; if the police pay you a visit all along of this man, don’t say I haven’t warned you !’ 4 Bah !’ grumbled Baptiste scornfully, though obviously alarmed at the idea. ‘ It’s no joke to harbour a criminal— as I warrant this man is, from what you tell me,’ continued Barber Savon. ‘ Maybe he had a hand in the goings on at Lyons,’ conj ■ ctured Jaqnes Menuble. Thus the trio continued chatting, as they smoked their tobacco and sipped their wine. The night advanced. As it grew dark, the lamp was lighted. The dame and , the rest of the household retired to rest, M. Trictrac furnished an exciting topic for the three cronies husiedih specnlationsrespccting him, an! hey remained with Baptiste until long past the usual hour. When at length hey prepared to depart, they dis covered that it was raining heavily and so returned, and recommenced smoking and talking, resolving to wait till the storm was over. A vivid flash of lightning eclipsed for a moment the feeble rays of the lamp ; the thunder lap that followed scorned ns if it would shatter (he little hostel. A violent summer tempest ensued. The trio, weary and awe-stricken, ceased their Milk, and sat listening in silence to she hurly-burly of the elements. As the thunder continued to roll infrequent peals, quick and heavy footsteps were beard overhead. M. Trictrac could not s’ccp, it appeared. Baptiste wondered whether his fiery gnest were rating the vealher. At any rate, it was very un leasant enough to make . anyone fidgety and nervous—to hear, amidst thunder, lightning, wind and rain, the incessant sound of footsteps, as of a person pacing hither and thither, agitated and restless. ‘ HarkT exclaimed Picirc Savon all at once, starting forward with a face >lismally pale. ‘ What ?’ ‘Listen 1 Again and again.’ The others listened attentively, but heard nothing. ‘lt has censed now/ said Pierre; ‘ but no—there !’ The low and mournful sound of a distant horn, seeming to come from the forest behind the house, was now plainly distinguished by alh As they continued to listen, the sound, which was repealed at short intervals, became more and more distinct, as if whoever produced it were rapidly approaching. Apparently, M. Trictrac heard the sounds also, for he ceased his agitated promenade and opened his window. And what was the astonishment of the three listeners when, as if in response to a sustained note from the distance, they heard the sound of horn issuing, sharp and clear, from the chamber of the strange guest! Thoughts of conspiracy, revo’ution, rob bery, rapine and everything horrible look possession of the trio; and each involuntarily rose to his, feet ns the loud notes streamed from the window of M. Trictrac. The sound of approaching hoofs, as of several horses urged to the top of their speed, was presently distinguished, and shortly afterwards four horsemen stopped in front of the house. Almost beside himself with 5 astonish ment and alarm, Baptiste hastily ex tinguished the candle and went to the window. The storm had ceased—the! clouds.,; were tearing wildly away—it grew lighter every instant. One of the; horsemen, who kept himself somewhat in advance of the rest, doffed his cap, and bowed towards M. Trictrac’s win dow, at which, no doubt, that individual had stationed himself. ‘ You arc come I it is well; and yon see I am here also/ said M. Trictrac. ‘ Ten thousand thanks! Oh, how shall I repay thee V exclaimed thehorse man in a tone of passionate gratitude. ‘ Did I not swear that nought should make'mo break my word ? and, behold, here I am, in spite of thunder, light ning, wind and rain.’ 1 Oh thy devotion.’ ‘ Ay, it is real ! and strengthened by the night ten thousandfold ; come what may, they ne’er shall make me leave thee; none but thyself shall drive me from thee-—and thou wilt not, I know. Oh light of love! this merry scheme shall seal our fates in joy ! What say you—ia’t to-morrow V ‘ls’t to-morrow ?’ ‘To-morrow!’ ‘ To-morrow ?’ ‘ Why, yes; thou know’st it is to morrow ; by thine own settling ’tis to morrow; by right it is to-morrow; Providence hath helped ns on, and by uck it shall be to-morrow.’; The speaker spurred his steed and moved close to the house, as near to M. Trictrac’s window as possible, and the two continued to talk in a lower tone, so that Baptiste could hear no more. Presently the horsemen rodp away as rapidly as they had come, and M. Tric trac closed his window. All this was fearfully mysterious to the cronies, but the night was too far advanced to talk over it at present, so they bade Baptiste adieu, and crept homewards ; and Jacques Mennblo waked his wife to tell the story of M, Trictrac, and spoiled the night’s rest of the good dame. Notwithstanding his long vigil, Baptiste was awake and stirring be times the next morning, nnxionsiy wait ing to hear M. Trictrac’s bell ring, feeling eager to see that gentleman after the occurrences of the preceding night. But the hours crept slowly on —seven, eight, nine, and no bell was rung. Baptiste grew fidgety. Ton, cloven, still no summons. Baptiste was in the highest slate of nervous excite ment. M. Trictrac, however, was certainly awake, for he could hear him moving about now and then Had ho not been so fat the anxious landlord would have crept up and peeped through the keyhole ; but as it was, his weight always set the stairs creaking at stub a rale that an attempt at eaves-dropping was sure of discovery. In the midst of his perplexity a noise was heard in the road, Baptiste hurried to the door. Two handsome carriages, in which were several ladies and gentle men, and each drawn by four fine mettlesome s'eeds, drew up before the house. Host Baptiste hardly knew whether he stood upon his head or his feet, he was so flurried and proud. A gentleman, whom Baptiste recognised as the young Cornto de Beanjois, alighted from the first carriage. Baptiste made his very best bow. ‘ You have a guest here, I believe— a pc. son who arrived here yesterday evening ?’ Baptiste bowed again. It was so. (7’o be Continued.)",Fiction

SIR, —Whilst giving kindly credit to the head and heart of your correspondent, "" Heart and Hand,"" in Monday's Star, I, as the largest advertiser in Auckland for ""married couples without incumbrance,' perhaps may be allowed a small space to shew the utter fallacy of his reasoning. It looks very pretty on paper. One, two, or more happy-faced children playing about the employer's property. Now, putting on one side that the one, two, or more happy-faced children eat and drink, and that most lustily, which the employer would have to be at the expense of, causing a less broad smile on his face than ""the play."" In this young colony the farming element is comparatively nevr. In England it is different, farms there have descended from father to son in many in stances for ages ; the grandsires initiated a sort of shelter for their labourers, their sons in due time improved that shelter, and so on down to the present time, when on numerous estates dottingsof smilinglabourers' cottages can be seen. All this, however, took time to accomplish. I think I am quite within the mark when I say that 19 out of every 20 farmers in Auckland have neither cot tages for married couples, nor capital to build them—all their available cash being expended or in course of being expended in calling the farm itself into ex istence ; and therefore the married farm helps for the most part reside under the same roof as their employers. Now, it does not require much reasoning on my part to shew that a lot of children (not your own) knocking about one's rooms would be pro vocative of feeling the very opposite of hilarious ; and I am half inclined to think that if such an affliction fell to the lot of "" Heart and Hand"" he would be apt to vote it a bore.—Yours respectfully, T.

Sir,— -I was exceedingly glad to see Mr. Me Lean's letter in last Saturday's issue. The subject is one that requires bringing forward, and I think the writer deserves the thanks of the Province, not only for his efforts in prospecting, but for speaking so plainly and to the purpose. It appears that it only rests with the Govern ment of the Colony to see those natives about it, who are standing aloof from us, and deal with them on reasonable teriut ; and then, no doubt, we shall be permitted to traverse their country in search of gold or other minerals. Who can blame the natives for keeping white people otf their land, when they don't know but what they are spies sent to entrap them for their misdeeds. Would not pakehas do tha same if they were 60 circumstanced ? True, many of the natives have forfeited their safety by their late rebellion, but as further war is not the wish of our rulers or of tho settlers, the authorities should lose no time in seeing the head men of those tribes, and make arrangements wheroby they may settle down in peace and quietness. If I mistake not, a promise was given tbe session before last, that one of the Ministry should come here and endeavour to treat with the natives and smooth over any difficulties that existed. This was not done. It is to be wished that the promise made last session to the same purport will not be like the former. Should it be so, I think the people of this settlement ought to speak out, and not be hood winked any longer. My fellow-settlers will agree with me that it is high time this native grievance was buried, and such inducements held out to settle down peaceably that the natives will have confidence in us and ' throw open their laud for prospecting The weather is fine and summer passing, and if something is not done soon, we may close up shop and be off to fresli fields and pastures new. — I am, Progress.",LetterToEditor

Her eloquent eyes wan dered so persistently to a botiqnet of syringa and red clover as to suggest there was a bit of human nature back of it. “ Tell me the story that goes with tbe flowers,” said her friend. She laughed softly, and her eyes be came moistly luminous. “ Oh, that came from my wild Irishman, and means a groat deal to me. “ He came to school a few months ago, a stranger to everybody. He was poorly dressed, and really appallingly ugly. His half-grown body was angular and ‘ ramshackle,’ his homely features were covered with butter-colour freckles ; he had horse teeth, upright, red hair, and small, white-slitted, pale-blue eyes. Not a single grace or beauty could be dis covered in the awkward, boy. “ However, at the end of a month, I learned, through several senses, that a new leader had come among us— Michael. By the law of compensation, he had been given enough voice and animal spirits for six average boys, and lie was spending them with lavish pro digality among his confreres. He ar rived on the playground as though shot out of a catapult, with electric • yells that might well come from a whole tribe of hostile Indians. He proposed the games, and led them, and was in the van or thick of everything according to its nature. As gaoler in prisoners’ base, he was truly terrible ; and as the head motor of crack-the-whip, nothing had ever been seen that approached him. The boys called him the ‘ Wild Irish man.’ “Michael’s career in the class-room was not so meteoric ; but he was too much of a wag to appear a dunce, and he scratched along after a fashion. One day his exuberance had led him into some offence which made me detain him after the afternoon session. When I can. in from the hall after dismissing the class, I found him in a somewhat rebellious frame of mind in the melan choly schoolroom-empty schoolrooms, you know, are heart-breakingly melan choly even to a tired teacher. I said : “ ‘ Michael, I am sorry yon do not do as well as you know how. Why can’t you he as much of a man as George Jones ?’ “ I said George Jones, because he was Michael’s nearest neighbour and a good boy, not thinking that George repre sented a home of culture and wealth. “ The question caused a more terrible commotion in Michael’s heart than I had intended. He threw his arms tragi cally on the desk, and dropped his head on them in abandon. After a torrent of teal's, he raised his not more beautiful face, aud said vehemently : “ ‘ Miss Gray, you know I can’t be a gentleman. I couldn’t be a lawyer ; I couldn’t be a doctor, and I am too homely to go into a store ; no one would have me even in a grocery store. My home is no good—my father drinks—it ■is no use trying—l can’t be- anything else—l have got to be the ‘ Wild Irish man,’ and the head fell again in an an guish of tears. “ This occurred two months ago. Soon after Michael succeeded in removing two of his monumental teeth, and dis locating his wrist at some athletic sports —happily outside the school limits—and has not been able to come to school since his loss. “ This bouquet, which talks of the gar den aud the fields, was brought to me this morning by a sister of the con valescent.”",Fiction

Sir, —All losers in a mining case naturally feel some little annoyance, and I should indeed be surprised if the losers in the above case did not do so, particularly as there is no rule bearing on the case. If they could not gain by law, at least they ought by equity. As an old experienced miner 1 was never aware, before to-day, that men could hold two claims when one of them was paying fair wages, as they themselves acknowledged in Court. If this is to be carried out, a party holding a number of miners' rights can monopolise not only the whole of a lead but the whole of a country, according to the number he holds, and by this a company could hold out and deprive the hard-work ing miner of his chance. This, indeed, is going contrary to what the General Government lately offered a prize for, viz.: "" the permanent settlement of the goldfields,"" for,shouldtheabove system be carried out, I am thoroughly con vincedthat the better part of the miners will leave the coast, or, if not, they must now, in self-defence, call meet ings among themselves and insist upon a mining conference for the revision of the rules. It is impossible that men earning their bread by the sweat of their brow can afford, for every little difference in mining, to have the answer given thera "" Tou must bring it before the Court."" I assure you, Sir, that this is the curse of this coast. The whole of the money the miners earn, after paying for "" tucker,"" goes in law.

When it was all over — when the grave was filled in Winifred awakened from her dream- Anxious eyes had watched her all day, but she had done all there was to do, even to the standing beside the grave which had been made close to the little hillock on which the grass was green. Comforters would have comforted her but she spoke no word,- only "" Leave me alone,"" and with a quiet step she went to her own room. Not the_room she had shared with Mary, but the room she had occupied before her guardian left them. Closing the door and locking it she sat down beside the bed on a low chair and buried her face in the pillows. Not one word — not a cry escaped her. She sat 'immovable as the hours went by. When the evening had come she stood up in the dark room, and, lifting her hand to her head, muttered some thing to the effect that Mary would be ex pecting her, then, without thought of cover ing, went out into the night. She walked feebly and slowly, but with a certain pur pose. Her eyes were fixed in one direction, nor did she turn or waver until she stood beside that newly-made grave; then she sat down beside it, and laid her head upon it as gently as if it were Mary's breast. By and bye from her lips came a low murmur. "" Mary I Mary ! Mary ! can I stay home and you not in it? Didn't I follow you when my feet were bare and the stones were cold and rough, Mary ? Since that first day when your father took me home has there been one day I have not seen you ? Even to-day, even to-day. To-morrow I shall not see you."" She turned and nestled into the earth, then, with a sudden change from the low tones to tones of agony, she went on "" To-morrow I shall not see you, nor the next day, nor the next, nor any day again for ever ! "" She buried her face between her hands and swayed backwards and _ forwards. "" How can I go through the days and weeks without you? What aim? What hope? What ambition have I for which to live ? It was something to be able to suffer for you, now I have only myself."" "" Sister,"" said a voice close by her side, "" let me bo your brother."" It was Charlie. He tried to raise her, but failing in this sat down beside her on the long grass, and laid his hand upon her shoulder. His face was hidden by the dark ness, but his voice though low was earnest with deep feeling. "" Do I not know how desolate your heart is 1 I know it by my own. But your grief is not like my grief. Mine is steeped in bitterness — the gall of self-reproach and regret. You were her saviour, I her slayer. You were her tower of strength, I dragged her to the earth. She and Almighty God may pardon me, myself I never shall forgivs. Ido not see my way one step before me. I know your darkness by my own ; yet for you a recompense must come, other love will comfort you — for me "" he turned his face and buried it on the grave. ""Oh Mary ! wife I mother of my boy, I shall always be alone."" He started to his feet and stood before Winifred, "" Winifred,"" said he, "" you have no pang I do not know intensified, your love has been a different love to mme — holier, loftier, more gentle, more self -sacrificing, — a blessing, a comforfc, a very angel ; mine has been cruel, a torture, a blight, a devil, but it is a man's one love for a woman. To you flowers of joy will blossom ; my life is in the cold earth with her. I feel it. I know it. I killed her, but I loved her. I am a man of strong passions. She was the only wo man in the world to me. No other woman shall ever take her place, or seem to take her place. I have crushed my life's one flower— l shall be very desolate, but I shall be true."" He paced backwards and forwards for a moment or so, then stopped again before the bowed figure on the grass. 11 1 know that I deserve it— there lies the sting. Think child. I came home re pentant. I meant to atone, perhaps, though I should not have had strength to do all I intended to do. Who knows? I had a demon in me inherited from our father. It might have caused her more pain, although, after what has passed, I hope I should have been wise. I came home to atone,, Winifred. I pictured home and wife and children — through all the future I shall be alone. Think of it child. Come, let me raise you. Come home, dear, the night air is chilly and you are uncovered. You will be ill next ; yet before you go if you could place your hand in mine and call me brother. Oh, Winifred, we have loved one and, the same — we are one in the same grief and desolation.

At these words the girl lifted her head. "" I need you "" was a bright call to her. To do was an instinct with her. She must accomplish or she would die. It was not in her nature to drift, there was too much pur pose in her to simply ie. Taking her hands Charlie assisted her to her feet. He held them closely in his and said again, "" I need your help."" "" I am your sister,"" she responded In low tones. He did not reply for a time beyond a fer vent "" Thank you,"" then, raising his hat, he said, turning to the graye — "" Mary, we are reconciled, here by your side, my love, and here too I vow that no future shall part you and me, my wife, ' Till death do us part ' we promised, but there is no death to love like mine. I came to make atonement. I mill make it. I seemed un faithful. I will not seem so again. My desertion disgraced you, but my faithfulness to my dead wife shall honour you. Even your clinging love shall be satisfied. Al mighty, give it to me to be as pitiful and lowly as she was — as merciful and tender to others as she was to me. O ! may I notbe all unworthy thy greatest gift— a human love divine in its compassion and steadfastness. I wa3 so loved. I will be worthy. Teach me — show me — I am a child again."" Close to him crept Winifred. His words kindled her heart— his cruelty and weakness and vanity she had despised. This humility and strength born of his sorrow she honoured, and with both hands clasping his she said "" My brother ! "" When he had asked for her help she had given herself to him "" I am your sister,"" when he showed strength of heart she took him into her own — "" My brother ! "" At the tones of her voice he bent forward and kissed her. ""Come home now, dear, and if you can bear it I will tell you of our parents."" She walked passively the short distance they had to go. Inside the house she led the way to her guardian's study. A fire was burninar in the grate and the reading lamp lit. Since Charlie's return this room had been used much against Winifred's will, for she held everything belonging to her guard ian as sacred. Charlie led her to an arm chair — Frank's armchair — and she leaned her head back on the cushions wearily. She was very pale and worn. There was a hope less, dejected air about her attitude that ap pealed for her. It was so unlike her to be utterly cast down. •' When he comes home,"" she said, as though thinking aloud, ""he will find things so changed — no wife, no child !"" Charlie had ordered some tea for her, which Mrs Grant now brought in with several dainty slices of toast, and pressed her to eat a little. Setting down her teacup, she asked of Charles suddenly : ""Did you ever see or hear anything of my guardian in London ?"" "" Nothing. Never a sign. Not that that goes for anything. My studies ocoupied me so entirely the first 12 months of my stay there. Afterwards I was equally absorbed in my hospital duties. I obtained an appoint ment as assistant surgeon atSt.Bartholomew's Hospital, and when my work was ended I had no heart or desire to go anywhere, ex cept for a solitary ramble, My mind was here with you all, I little knew the distress that had come upon you. I pictured the home always as I had known it — death and poverty, mystery and disgrace never entered the picture. Sometimes I fancied Mary might forget me. I always knew that I had been cruel to her. This thought haunted me persistently. Sometimes I decided to return home; then some evil thought prevented me. How long this sort of thing would have gone on I cannot say, had not something happened that decided me. Shall I go on, my dear ? It ie something that concerns you, too."" "" Go on, if you please."" "" One evening I had retired to my room when I was summoned to assist at the amputation of the leg of a poor unfortunate creature who had been knocked down and run over by some passing vehicle. She was an old woman, with a hard-featured, hag gard face, showing signs of dissipation and want. She was in a half-starved condition and suffering from the effects of drink. After the operation signs of delirium set in, and being somewhat anxious over her, I re turned with the head surgeon, who had per formed the operation, and we held a con sultation over her. He, did not hold out great hopes of her recovery, for her constitu tion was shattered by irregular living. I could not account fop it at the time, but tho case peculiarly interested me. Sights like this were no novelty,; but I could not get the poor wretch out of my mind. So, about midnight, I followed, the strong im pulse upon me, and returned to the accident ward."" Winifred had listened with a quiet in terest so far, her head resting upon the pillows of the chair, her eyes fixed upon the glowing coals, The dramatic gift of the narrator unconsciously framed his gestures and directed his tones, and as unconsciously worked upon his hearer. She lifted her dark eyes to his as he went on. ""The ward wn-s very silent, the lamps were dimly burping, and the night nurse was moving silently among the white-draped beds, the qceupants of which were mostly sleeping. Suddenly through the silence, from the bed where the injured woman lay, rang a cry : "" Ohalk 1"" Winifred started and clasped her hands, but did not interrupt him. "" • Chalk ! ' My heart stood still. I saw a queenly girl, and"" near her another, fair and fragile— Mary. « Chalk I Where is Chalk ?' the woman repeated, and the nurse and I were soon beside her. ' She's been calling for Chalk for the last hour, sir,' said the nurse, ' and I can't pacify her, for who or what Chalk is heaven only knows.' ' Leave her with me,' I said, and the nuise went away and left us. ' ' Chalk, Chalk, Chalk ! ' came from the hot and parched lips. 4 Who said I ill-tre?ted her? She? 'Tis a lie, I say. She never said it, Sold '—did she say I sold her ? Well ?— and if I did, it was to a good man. It was the best day's work I ever did for her — the best, I say — for hadn't I robbed her of a father and mother ?' "" "" She — she was the woman whom I called aunt,"" faltered Winifred. "" She always said she picked me np a deserted infant, and this was not true. Mv mother did not desert me."" "" No, dear sister, our mother loved you too well."" ""Thank God!"" The exclamation was a fervent one, as the passionate earnestness of her tone told. It had been such a bitter thought to her always that her mother had loved her so little she could leave her in a barn to die. Never mind what her mother's faults may have been she could have forgiven all, save that desertion. And not because she had been the baby, but because it was a baby, and her mother its mother. "" She did not desert me,"" repeated Wini fred. "" She did not. I have much to tell — more than I learnt for weeks, for my patient was in a high fever, and beyond the incoherent wanderings of delirium I could learn nothing. She cried out frequently for some letter which she said was stitched in one of her undergarments, and search being made, I found this packet."" He took from his breast as he spoke a soiled packet and handed it to Winifred ; she took it and read the super scription. 1 From Madeline, Mary,' 1 Wife of Charles Hurlington Mason,' 1 To her dear daughter, Madge.' "" The names were those of my father and mother. I took the delirium - tormented woman by the hand and asked in imperative tones. "" Who is this Madge ?"" For an instant her reason returned — her sight became clear and her voice distinct. She lifted her sunken eyes to mine and said, ' Who is Madge — Madge Mason ? God have mercy on my soul ; 'tis Chalk. Her lady mother. Oh, she was a beauty, was Made line Mason, with great black eyes like Chalk's. She left me a heap of money to use for her, but I stole the money amd hid the child. She left a blue parasol behind her that day. I gave it to Chalk ; ask her if I didn't ; find her and ask her. Frank Hunter, of Birming ham, bought her for £10, and when you have found her give her that letter.' She sank back upon the pillow, and murmured, ' Forgive me, Chalk. She would if she saw me now. She was allers tender of heart, was Chalk; proud in the spirit and tender of heart was Chalk.' Clasped her hands as if in supplication, and died. (lo be continued.)",Fiction

John OKriKCTOK recovered but slowly Xtata the illness which had been brought on tiy Dhe shock of finding that his son who, sines his return from tho colonies had caused him so much anxiety, had been ar. rested for murder. As soon as ho was ablo to bear the strain Of ""a long interview tho convalescent learned Iroia hi?real son tho true {'nets of tho case. You know how 1 got on, dad, after I arrived at the farm. I didn't write you often, not so often ay I should have done, I know, but out there letter-writing was about tho last thing we thought of. Still 1 let you know that I was well and comfort able, and when I could I sent a little monoy florae. ■::• 'You did, Will. You were o. good eon,' paid his father, clasping the young man's Land affectionately. Soon after I arrived, and had shown Mr Wilson,, the farmer who gave mo my first job, thab I was willing to work, he began to take an interest in me, and so did hig wife. They were very nico peoplo; not, what would bo called rich folks, but com fortable off. and they wore reckoned very good to their hands. When i first went I had to look after horses and do odd jobs about tho place, but one day I happened to bo in the room when the farmer was swearing because he couldn't get some inures right that he'd gotdown|on paper. They wore his accounts, and he aUvaya had a bad time with them. I asked him to lot me look at the figures; perhaps I could make them como right. Mr Wilson stared at me, and 1113 wife, Who was sitting opposite to him, looked up feo»n her work and laughed. 'Lsfc mo look, if you please, sir,' l said. 'I think if you'll toll me what ifc ia that bothers you 1 may be able to put ifc right. 1 1 Do you understand arithmetic ?' 'Oh-, yes, I took a prize in arithmetic at jfny sohool.' "" lI)id you, my lad?' said tho farmer. ' Well, it' you'll make theso darnel figures niake sense of ihcmsclve?, you shall feako a prize here.* I Went over all tho items and checked Mia figiiife, and ib wasn't lon£ beforo I iooix'i out where Mr Wilson had got wrong. \h was a simple sum in arithmetic that, I had done, bub ib made a great impression on the farmer and hia wife, and after that I had ail his accounts to check, and iitidin^ I could write a good readable hand ho used to give me all lm letters to write, and 1 v;tis a"" good deal in tho house, and was Well treated* though they didn't give me much mot'S money, as thoy were rather near sort of people. However, I was quite contented, for I 'liked the life, and nob bavins? 50 much outdoor work to do I managed to find time to read 11 pood bit; and to improve myself in many things. The men about the place were all decent; fellows, bub too old for me to fessociato with, so I hadn't many com panions, and there wasn't much amusement in a placo like that, so that all my spare time I spent in reading and studying. You know, dad, I was always fond of books, and I never forgot that we'd been tvhafc's-.callod gentlefolk once. 'You ware ri^hb, my boy, to remember &.■ folks can come down in the world and (still have a bit of wide about; them.' After I'd been with the Wilsons about five years there were some new people came into the neighbourhood. They were a family named Sandys from Ontario, and it was said they'd lost a fortune in some big speculation, andnow they were going to Settle down here at the farming with gome menoy thafc had been found for them by a relative. They took a farm that was in the market called 'Spring's Farm,' a email place about, two miles from us, and we soon got to know something of them, as Mr Wilson, my master, and Mr Sandys got ac quainted and became great friends, visiting at each other's houses and riding about tha Country a good deal together. Mrs Sandys was a groat invalid, so the house wa? looked after by the daughter, Belle. She wca a very pretty girl, and only fifteen, but very tall, and thafc made her look a lot older. Her father called her ""Fairy,' and she was a household fairy to him, there's no doubt about that, for she Vas his right hand. | . The first timo she came to our pl«.co with hey father I couldn't take my eyes oft'her. She was the nicest girl I'd ever seen, and there wasn't any that came within miles of her in our narfc. ' While the farriers were talking, I took her all ovor our place and showed her the cattle and the horses, and she asked me a lob of questions about the country round about and the people, and wo got quite friendly. Then w,e got talking about; Eng land, as she'd beard I w?.3 English, and she was awfully interested in London. She said she'd heard and read such a lot about it, and always wanted to see ib. They were to have gone to Enrope the year that the smash came, she told rae. After that, of course everything was altered for the:n, and they had to give up their beautiful home, and come right away and settle down in a new place. I could see that they'd been through a bad timo, and poor Belle's face wa3 very sad whon she spoke about her father's misfortune, As she talked so friendly to me-about her troubles, I thought there could be no harm m telling her mine. We gob so interested in each other's stories that we stopped talking for an hour, and forgot all about the old folks inside ; and when Mr Wilson came out and began to Ehoub to us, and to say ho thought wo were lost, I couldn't believe thab wa 7d been away more than ten minutes. After that we were very friendly, and whenever Belle came over she always asked lor me, if I was away on the land ; and she brought me a horse her father had bought her to ride, and asked me to break «in a bib more for her, as ib was a little more than she could manage as it was. You may be sure I was glad to do her a service, and I soon had that horse rin-ht: and when I took ib homo and she'd tried it and found the difference in it, she paid me no end of compliments. Mr Sandys would navo me come in and take tea with the inmily, and there I saw Mra Sandys for the nrsc time. klv T U ™7, beailW»l woman and a JJ7.

'London's a big place, sit, 11 said, 'and t daresay there are thousands of Hewitts in It. 1 don't kno# anybody of that name. Why do you ask'?' * , <,^'l) Onty because we've got a young relloyr coming to us ho£e who's a Londoner^ and Ins name's Hewitt. I thought you might know something- about him.' Then he explained that hod had an offer through a friend of his in Montreal to take a young English lad and let him learn the farming at his place, He was fco have a premium, and the lad'a friends would pay for his lodging: and board, ao h«5 thought it would bo rather a good thing. I didn't quifco know why ib\vas then, but I dida't like the idea of a young English lollow coming to stay there and be near jjsllc every day 4 But, of course* I couldn't say that to them, bo I talked about some thing else, and wished Master Hewitt at JorichOi It was two months after that before I heard of Master Hewitt again. Belle rode over to our placo with a, mes sage to Mr Wilson from her father, and she told me that Hewitt had arrived. ' What's ho like 11 said, hoping that sho would say thab he was a horrid sort of a fellow. 'Well, Will,'she said, 'it's the oddest thing, but he's like you ; so like you that you might almost be' brothers, and"" I should think ho was About tho same age.' That made me very uncomfortable, you know, dad, bocau.se, as I dare say you have guessed, by this time. I was very much in love with Belle, and I'd made up my mind that as soon as 1 was old enough and I saw a chance of doing something for myself I'd ask her to bo my sweetheart. You see this was tho nasty part of It. If Belle liked mo and thought I was nico-look ing, and this Hewitt fellow resembled mo as much as she said ho did, then she must liko him and think him nice - looking too. And he'd be always with her, and I should be always away from her, and that would give him a very unfair advantage over me. i didn't eat my supper that night with ao much apnetlto as usual; and when I went to bed I didn't go to sleep, which was a most unusual thing- for me. I kept on thinking about this Hewitt fellow, and I thought it was very impudent on his part to bo like me. 1 made up my mind I'd go to Sprig's fai;m nt tho first opportunity, and take the measure of the younj; gentle man and ace if he was tho sort of fellow who was likely to cut me out. When I did get to sleep at last, Master Hewitt was evidently still in my mind, for I had a most terrible dream. Knowing what I do now. looking at that dream by the Jijrht of what happened afterwards, every incident of ib corner back to me as vividly as though I had jusfc awoke from ifc. In my dream Belle and 1 wore walking; together by the river. I was telling her how much I loved her, and asking her to bo my sweetheart. She blushed at first, and hun£ her dear little head down, bub sho didn't take her hand away. I'd <jot tight hold of that, and wasn't £,;oing to let ibffO. ' Belle, dear,' I said (in my dream, you know, dad) ' Bello, dear, you don't know how I love J rou, how I've loved you ever pince the firat day you cams over to our farm. I'm, nothing hero, bub I've been studying and. working hard, and I'm bound to pet on. If 3 ron'3l only cay that some day you'll be my UttlQ wife, it'll give me all the hope ami all the courage I want, and 111 work and work ti)l I've won a position and mode a home worthy of you.

There was a bright little tear in each of them. 1 Will,'she said, 'I'm not going- to tell you a story. Ido love you, very very much indeed.' 'And you'll be my sweetheart? You'll lot us be engaged to each other, dear, and you'll never marry anybody bat me ?' "" ' No, Will, I'll never rntirry anybody but you.' "" With aery of joy I put ray arm round her, and was about to draw her to me and press my lips to her?, when she sprang back with a cry of alarm. Something had come between u3. I looked, and it was mysolf I saw—myself, yet not mo, for ib was between myself and Belle. , . I knew in a minuts who ib was—it was Hewitt. His face was white with rage, and he held his fist clenched above my head. ' You shall never have Belle for your wife,' he . cried : ' you snail never have any woman for your wife, for I mean to kill yon.' , , "" Before 1 could move or utter a word he drew a knife from his belt-, end lifting it brought) ifc down again with fearful force, burying it to the hilt in ray heart, A3 the sharp- steel struck into my flesh I uttered a shriek and flung my arms up and --and woke up to find myeelf lying on my back and moaning.

At loefc my power of will came back again, and with an effort I sprang out of bed. and finding the matches, struck one and lighted the c*ndle that stood by my bedside. J couldn't summon up the courage^to blow it out again, even after the first im prenrion of the nightmare had passed away. T was thoroughly unnerved.

W hen I got a letter from home I used to read it to him, and he got to know them all quite well through me. He soon found out timt I was in love with Belle, and he promised me he Wouldn't breathe a word to anybody iabont it. That was my secret, and I think:l rather liked it being a secret, fancying it more romantic. Hewitt was as frank with me as I had beSn with him, and told me all about himself. His father and mother were dead ; they wore gentlefolks, but had been poor, and he had b6en taken by his uncle, who had promised to give him a start m life. ' And a nice start he's given me,'said Hewitt, 'sending me out to this God-forsaken place, and telling we it's my only chance, and that's all hs can do for mo, as he's a married man with a large family him?elf. .It's a nice look-out for me. Oh, Lord, I wish I'd been going to be rich—l shall never make a farmer.' He was quite right there—he never would, for he didn't take to it at all, and if it hadn't been for the premium and the yearly money paid for his keep I expect Mr Sandys would have got fid 0? him pretty quick. He was always talking about what a jolly life hod have when he grow up if he only had money, and once he said to mo that he didn't think there wa3 much he'd stick at to make it. I thought he was only bragging—talk ing wild like young- fellows will sometimes. I was so .grateful to him for not falline in love with Belle that I didn't like to think he was really a bad-hearted follow. Besides, he was very useful to ma and helped me with Belle. He used to invite me to come over sometimes of an evening, and that gave me an excuse for being at Sprigg's farm. And when he and I and Belle went out for a walk about the place together, he'd go ofl and leave us alone, which I thought it very nice and gcntle man'y of him. After he'd been at Spring's farm about three years ho wrote homo and got somo money from his uncle. I suppose he told him he could do some good with it and he wouldn't ask for any more ; and then he went away and I didn't see anything of him for some time. Ho wrote me once or twice from the town he'd Krone to, and paid be was doinn 'middling,' but I gathered from his letters that ho'cl got in with a bad set, and wa3 rather down on his luck. All this time I was working and keeping1 in Farmer Wilson's aood books, and though I pot a bit more money it wasn't ranch, hue TVi made myself master of the business, and I believed that when I was a bit older I should bo able to get into something better, and in due time, perhaps, launch out on my ov,-n account and bo independent. I hod wonderful dreams, I can tell you, dad, of what I was Koine to do, and I told Bello, and she was as enthusiastic as I was. It was Fettled that wo wore sweethearts, though we dirln'fc tell anybody else. I was to mnko a lucky hit, and wo woro tn be married and have n. beautiful place of our own, and then we were gome to send for you and tho girls to come out to us. • That's how things went on till about a year apo. At that time I'd done pcveral rjood .strokes of business for the farmer, acd one dny he told me that ho was think ing of taking another farm and that he'd pub me in to manage it, and r*ivo me a shn.ro. It was inst after the farmer had told me this that Hewitt turned up again. He came, back again looking rather eeody and ouc of elbuw, and tcob taken on as a clerk at a store in a little town a few miles from us, just near enough for me to sco something of him, as I often had to go over to the town on business. Ho didn't say much about what he'd been doing, only that he'd had rather bad luck. I was glad to have him back again, for I wanted somebody I could make a confidant of, and, of course, I told Mm what my ex pectations were, and how Bolloand I had made up our minds to get married as soon aa I'd gob a position that would let mo pa to her people and ask them to lot me be their son-in-low. Then cams the wonderful news. I'd been away for two days on the farmer's business, and when I got back there was your letter waiting for me, telling me that you'd come into a fortune, and that I was to come back, and that we should be gentlefolks again and have everything that we could want. I couldn't believe it at first. Bub as soon as I had realised what it meant, and that you wanted me to come back to England, I went off straight up to Spring's farm and told Belle, and then I saw her father and mother and told them, find then I sum moned up my courage and asked them if Bello and I might be engaged to bo mar iner?. I expected it would be a bit of a surprise to them, bub, bless you, it wasn't at all. Mr Sandys laughed, and said he'd .seen what was in the wind nil ftlonff, and asked me if I though* he was blind. Poor Belle blushed when her father said he'd known we were in love with each other all along, bub her mofchor to.d her there was nothing to be ashamed of, for I was a steady hard-working young man, and if they hadn't thought highly of me they shouldn't have allowed me to come there so often. When they heard that 1 had to go back to England, and that you wanted me to stop there, they hesitated a litble. They didn't like the idea of Bolle having to live f,o far away from them, and Belle said ib would grieve her too to have to leave her mother. So wo talked ib over, and then the farmer let out that lie had an idea of giving up his farm, for which he had a good offer, and coming to England, whore his wile had relatives, and that perhaps things might bo arranged so that after all it wouldn't! be such a bis break up. But ifc was agreed that Belle and I should be engaged, and when I got home 1 was to telf you all about it, and write and leb them know what you said, and perhaps by thab time Mr Sandys would be- aole to come to Europe with his family. If not I should have to go back and get married there. . . , After that I sent you a cable, saying that ; I could start for home, and begin to make my preparations, which didn't take ma long. The draft you sent me in the letter was more than enough to bring me home, , so I had only to draw my savings oub of the bank. They were a good round sum, for1 yon see I'd been putting every penny by to do something with when the chance came. One of the first persons who heard the news of my having como into a fortune was Mark Hewitt. The day after he heard ib he came over to the farm. Ho congratu lated me on my good luck and asked me all about it. Of course I told him everything. 'By Jove, Will,'he said, 'you're a lucky fellow. You'll live like a gentleman now for the res); of your days, and have your pockets always stuffed full of gold and bank note?, and there won't be anything you can'b have. By Jove, what a time I'd ""have of ib if I had your chtir.ee.' We pat smoking and talking, and all of a sudden he said, ' Will, if I ask you to do mo a favour will you be offended ?' ' Certainly not,' I said. 'Then look here, old chap; pay my pasaage to England and leb me come with yon"" You'll be lonely travelling by your self, and I want to get to London badly. If I can see my uncle he'll give me another start in the old country. I know, and I'm 'sick of the dog's life I'm leading now. I'll pay you back every penny you advance me as soon as I:vo seen my uncle.' What was Ito say ? It would havo been mean to refuse, especially as I had plenty of money to spare oub of my savings, and you'd 3ent me'far more than I wanted. So I consented, and it was agreed that Mark Hewitt and I were, to sail by the same ship. A week after that I sa iJ good-bye to Belle, promising her that she should soon hear from me, and telling her the parting wouldn't be for long, and Mark Hewitt and I set out for Quebec, from which placo we wsre to sail for Liverpool. We didn't leave together, but we met on tho road at a place some fifty miles from my starting point. Hewitt had begged me not to say to a eoul that he was leaving, or that he was to be nvv travelling companion. He explained that if it got known he raitrht bo prevented, and 2 foolishly gave him the promise and kept it. Instead of going direct to Quebec, having a day or two to spare, Hewitt persuaded mo to make a detour in order that he might call on some friends of his who lived in a small town. We sent all the luggage on ahead direct to tho ship. Hewitt hadn't much, and so it was all sent on in my name. , • We arrived at the town, and there Mark, after making a few inquiries, found that his friends had moved a few miles out. It was not very far,, and we agreed to walk. To my surprise Hewitt knew every inch of the ground, and I soon gathered that he had spent a short time in tho place on his way out from England. i Jart of our way lay through a wood, and as it was very thick and very lonely I was afraid we should lose our way and not get back again in time for the night train. Hewitt assured me he knew the path, and we went on. When we had been in the wood about ten minutes the path became so narrow that we could only walk one in front of the other. Hewitt went first. Suddenly he turned round. I caught the look on hia face and started back ; but be fore I could cry out or defend myself I felt a sharp pain in my breast, and knew that I had been shot. I thought I heard a sound ns of some thing moving in tho wood, but in a moment I fell to the ground. As I fell I struck my head violently against tho trunk of a tree, and in a moment all was darkness, for my senses left me. When I came to myself I was in a strange place. It was a little whitewashed room, and I was in bed. I tried to raise myself and speak, but I was unable to do so. I could see a strange face beside me—tho face of a man—and then all was darkness again. When I recovered my senses a little, I discovered that I had had brain fever, and that I had been ill for many weeks. ■ Even when I recovered sufficiently to see people and understand a little I could remember nothing, and could give no account of myself. It was three months before my senses fully returned and I discovered what had happened. At one time the doctors believed that I would never recover my reason again, as the injury to tho head had temporarily affected the brain. I had been found lying apparently dead in a wood with a pistol clutched in my hand. It was supposed that I had at tempted to commit suicide. I was carried to a cottage hard by, and the people kept me there and sent for a doctor, and then it was found that I vros too ill to be moved. As soon as I could remember all the circumstances I told the doctor, and tho police were sent for. As I had been robbed of my papers as well as the money I had about mo, it was supposed that Hewitt had left for Eng land, believing that I was dead, and that he would make use of hi^ likeness to mo to palm himself on my father as his lonsr absenfc son. His knowledge of my past history and of my relatives, gained in con nection with mo during many years, and my having read him .all my letters from home, would help him in his attempt to impose on them. It was explained to me that in tho place in which I wan found I might have lain for months undiscovered but for accident, as it was in a part of the wood through which there was no thorough fare, and in"" which a man who had hung himpolf to a trae had. remained hanging until lie was a skeleton. This wns a legend of fho place and had probably been known to Hewitt, who had calculated his chances from fche beginning. No one knew of my journey to the place, an ih was right out of my route, there was nothing about me to provo my identity if found, so far as Hewitt knew, as he. had taken all my papers fmm my pocket after I fell, and he concluded that if ever I was found I should be buried as an unknown suicide. There would be no inquiry for Will Orpington, as Will Orpington per sonated by Hewitt would have arrived safoly in London and be with his family. As soon as the police heard my story they were anxious to telegraph to Eng land at once, but I begged them not to. 1 wanted to como over myself and see what Hewitt, had done. It would only make a difference of a few weeks, and so it was ar ranged. I left by the first vessel after I was' convalescent,and immediately I arrived hero I found that a Will Orpington was known, and he was discovered by the police to bo living at an hotel in London. As goon a=> we were sure of him he was ar rested afc the hotel on a charge of murder. I immediately left to see you, and to my hoiror found that you had been to the hotel, heard of the arrest of your supposed son, and had been seized with a fit. Now you know the whole story, dad. Since you have been ill, Hewitt has been sent back to Canada to take his trial, and I have to appoar-against him there. I must po by the tiest ship; but I shall soon be back, and I hope, dad, when I return I shall bring Belle with me. Lizzie and Polly ore in love with her already from what I have told them, and I'm sure you'll think her the best little daughter-in-law in the world. And so John Orpington did. To-day he is as veil and strong as ever, and he is delighted with hia son, <md proud of his son's wife. There, is no fear of their squan dering the fortune that came to the Orpingtons after years of poverty. Will's early experiences as a young emigrant taught him the value of money, and he has a good little domesticated wife to_ make him contented, at home, and to assist him in proving that the greatest _ happiness wealth can bring is the power it gives its possessor to do good to his less fortunate fellow-creatures. BeMo's father and mother came over soon after'their daughter left for England, and ate now settled in the old country. They always spend their Christmas at John Orpington's house, and when the two families meet they rarely fail to talk of Will's marvellous escape from death, and of the diabolical plot which nearly resulted in Mr Orpington accepting as his heir the scamp who had tried to murder his son in order to personate him and enjoy his inheri tance.

If you will per mit a little more cheap advertising I would like to make a reply which I promise shall be in better temper than his. I will not use such terms as “ impudent” or “ contemptible,” neither will I criticise spelling, or the public will say / have a bad case also. I will refrain from personalities, and act up to that little bit of good advice “ strive to say no harm, &c.” which, bye the bye, while giving, Mr Gorrie certainly did not follow. I will therefore first answer his question “What needs Mr Griffith’s trouble, &c.” and then tell him a little story. A Share List having been published, it became public property, and I considered it my duty as a Sharebroker to criticise the same and prevent incorrect ideas being formed of the value of shares. First because it was an injury to the public to permit a misconception, and secondly I considered it injurious to myself in its ten dency by injuring the sale of shares in my hands. However the remarkable difference in the two share lists is now accounted for. Mr Gorrie’s standard for discovering the market value of shares it appears is the amount that certain holders are firm in demanding ; mine is the price they are to be purchased for. I leave it for the pubile to decide whose valuation is the fairer. Now for the story, which Mr Gorrie’s system of valuation, brings to my mind. “A young man desperately in love, and fearing obstructions from the father of his choice, solicited a mutual friend to arrange matters. The great objection which he feared the stern parentwould urge was his poverty. What was to be done ! At last his friend hit upon an expedient. "" Would you take £20,000 for your nose?” said he. “Good gracious, no,” said the young man. “ £50,000 ?” “ Not I indeed.” Away posted the mediator, and at once obtained an interview with the much dreaded paterfamilias. The subject was introduced. “What means has he?” said the father. “Well, I cannot exactly tell” said the other, “ but this morning I distinctly heard him refuse £50,000 for one piece of property he owns, and which I know he intends settling upon your daughter if you consent to the match.” The elderly party relented of course. Ergo —The market value of noses is £50,000. —I am, &c. C. J. W. Griffiths.",LetterToEditor

Dear Sir, — Amongst the desiderata of the Imperial Museum of Natural History in Vienna, respecting our visit to New Zealand, is likewise the obtaining or i-o ne more particular information about a silkworm, occurring upon wild brushes and shrubs in the bush in some parts of New Zealand, the cocoon of which is snid to yield a most beautiful kind of silk. It was reported in German newspapers that some Glasgow mercantile firm has already made experiments with the cocoon of the New Zealand silkworm, and has found it to yield a quality of silk superior by far to any one actually produced in any part of Europe. My first endeavour in arriving in ti.is interesting country— blessed by na ture with so numeroui invaluable gifts — wu to get come information respecting the silk worm of this coun try, which i 9 found on wild bushes ; but although I addressed myself to gentlemen, who, by their position, learning, and occupation, might hare been most proba bly in the case of knowing something about it, lam sorry to say that, till this very moment, I have not been able to acquire any more minute information on this subject, But I should not like to leave this country as ignorant, respecting the silkworm in question, as I came to it. I therefore take the liberty to make use of your far circulating newspaper in order to bring the subject before the public, and to get perhaps some more information of it by this channel, as I suppose that the silkworm in question does not occur in vhe vicinity of Auckland — but perhaps more to the South. Hoping you will excuse my liberty, in requesting you to give some space to this query in the next num ber of yonr newspaper, as it might perhaps likewise be of some interest to your Auckland readers to hear some particulars on a native caterpiliar that may become of so infinite value to the Country, I have the honour to be, with true regard, dear Sir, Your most obedient, Dr. Kabl Scherzfr, Member of the Scientific Commission on board H.

Sir,— A9 you have called upon the Editor of the ' Ex aminer ' to give reasons for separation from the other Provinces, I will give you one, which I have not seen notic-d by any of the advocates of thaf measure, al though, in my opinion, it is the most important of the whole, and quite sufficient of itself to settle the ques tion. The Southerns, having the whole of their land avail able, have shown a determination, if possible, to keep a large proportion of the land in this Province locked up in the hands of the Natives, thereby rendering it useless to the settler, retarding the progress of the North, and giving the South a decided advantage. They believe the WakeSeld system to be beneficial, because they have never felt the full effects of it. Had the whole of the land at Canterbury been rendered use less, except that which was sold at three pounds an acre, it is evident the colony must have been ruined, instead of being the most prosperous settlement in New Zealand, made bo by the squatters pasturing sheep and cattle on cheap land, not in consequence of the Wake field Land System, but in direct opposition to it. The amount of injury done by the high price of land sold, not being severely felt, from having all the country available for pasturage at very moderate rates ; but even there the high price has been found to be an evil, and I believe it has been reduced, and a credit system adopted, which is like telling the agricultural settlers, "" we intend to cut all your right hinds off, but as we know it will be a serious injury to you we will not do it for five year 6."" Many of the Southern law makers are benefited by the present land regulations, by being supplied with roads and labour, without paying a full proportion of the expense, and they naturally oppose any alteration which would oblige them to pay their full share ; and they are also well aware that, if this Province was put on a fair footing with the South, by having the country opened, the advantage? we possess in climate and the valuable Native population would soon enable us to distance them in the race of colonization, therefore they are determined to persist in the present system, which giveß them a decided advantage over this Province ; — »d I holiove the only chance ,we have of getting fair play is to "" CUt me parrrrer,- *mn sepnraie rromihem; — Mr. Sewell, whose whole interest is with the South, is perhaps the worst enemy Auckland ever had, except Sir George Grey, for he hus succeeded in so binding all the Provinces together that he has increased the dif ficulty of separation, and as there is a powerful party in England who, from interested motives, will oppose it, it will require great unanimity and determination on the part of the Auckland people to accomplish the object.

Sir, — May I presume to ask your per mission to occupy a small space in your columns in reply to a letter signed ""An Old Resident"" that appears in the West Coast Times of July 16. I should imagine by the tenor of his letter that the writer would wish the community to believe that the petition referred to, viz., against the land applied for by Mr Nancarrow, has been signed by the miners here under a false impression, and at the persuasion of a certain gentle man resident here, running cattle at pre sent in the Lake district. Now, Mr Editor, "" Old Resident ' must think that the miners here are a parcel of idiots or that the gentleman re ferred to must possess more influence over them tban is exactly agreeable to them selves. Next, with regard to the gentle man's vision of removing cattle, &c. If "" Old Resident"" were acquainted with the locality in question, he would at once see that the land applied for would in no way interfere with the interests of the party, as his run does not come within five miles at least of the land applied for, conse quently there could be no necessity for the removal of his cattle. Further I may inform "" Old Resident "" that it is well known that gold has been got by several parties not residing at the Greenstone, in the locality referred to, and I think I may safely say that the petition sent down against the sale of 6000 acres is emphati cally endorsed by every miner in the dis trict, and were it riot for the difficulty of getting tucker, &c, out to the place, I may confidently assert that it would command a fair population at the present time. In conclusion, I notice that the petition has been presented and received by the Council, and I trust that that body will give the matter their most serious con sideration before sanctioning the sale of so large a bock of land. Yours, &c, FAIR PLAY. Greenstone, July 18, 1873. (To the Editor. J Sib, — I beg permission to reply to "" Old Resident's"" letter in your issue of the 16th instant. Taking him at his own estimate he really is a poor hand at writing a "" plain unvarnished tale,"" and what a pity knowing this he should have emerged from that obscurity which he so well adorns, Like the three tailors of Tooley-street, who constituted themselves the people of England, he has the hardihood to wrife 04 behalf of the people of the Greenstqne, whom he implies have been led, under a false impression, to sign a protest against the granting of Mr Nancarrow's applica tion, to purchase 6000 acres of land in the Lake Brunner district. If "" Old Resident"" is sincere in his belief that such was the case why did he no* get up a counter petition ? If he had done so I venture to assert (leaving out bis satellites) that he would not obtain half-a-dozen signatures. Many of the miners who signed that petition against Mr Nancarrow's applica tion are well acquainted with the nature of the country he applies for, and they believe whether rightly or wrongly, that any future extension of the present gold work ings in this district may be looked for in the direction of the Lake, and they are naturally alarmed that any speculator should be permitted to take up such a large portion of the district before it is pros pected. '"" Old Resident's ""letter appears to be influenced by personal and not by patriot icmotives as he would make it ap pear, evidently the grazier is a thorn in his side. I may remark en passant that the gentleman at whose expense he tries to be witty, has done more to assist the miners and to develop the mineral resources of this district than "" Old Resident "" has done, or is erer likely so do.

Sir, —""Would you bear with me a little while I expatiate on my views of the resources of the Western District. I shall neither willingly v>xag gerate nor set down aught in malice. Our late ; Superintendent of Otago struck a high key note I when he estimated our timber resources at the I money value of £500,0000,000. I have heard some men laughing greatly at this, but suppose j you allow a discount of £-170,000,000, you would : still leave u suilleient stun to pay the New Zealand ! debt and finish all the railways in the schedules. | Now, laughing I believe to be a lino exorcise, but j like other things it requires discretion and j.u Ig- I ment to use it properly. A better specimen of j the absurd could not he desired than a man who j is grave when he ought to laugh and then laughs whan ho ought to be grave. A little reflection, I think. wTI show that gravity U the proper de portment with which to receive Mucandrevv’s estimate. The Western District does not mean merely the strip of countiy between Riverton and Orcpuki, but it extends beyond that to the Waiau River, tbon both banks of the Waiau, and Westward still over magnificent forest country to the West Coast of New Zealand. A gentleman of undoubted authority (Mr M‘Ker row) who has travelled over most of the distance, estimated the girth and height of some of those trees ho passed in groves to be 27ft to 29ft in girth, and 70ft to 80ft to the nearest branches — tolara. According to him it is a region of wood land Anaks (vide report to Otago Provincial Council, June 2, 1871). The Western Waiau District is not likely to claim much attention until the forests require to be drawn on for timber supply. Totara, black and red pine and the varieties of birch abound Near the sea some of the trees attain dimensions unequalled in any other forests of Otago. Then take up your station at the Lower Waiau, and turn your face northwards. The leafy scene extends as far as the eye can reach, and much further, for it extends along the side of onr western Alpine range, with the adjoining vales and plains, at, I suppose, a varying breadth of 400 or 500 miles. In fad, nearly tho length and breadth of the Middle Island. All this is the Western District; but it is not all our Western District. How much of it, then, might fairly be termed oars? As much of it as wo a Id find its easiest outlet at Riverton. Now, sir, let it never be forgotten that the Waiau runs within seven miles of the Orepuki Railway. This implies water carriage for timber, &e., the whole length of that river. Nor is this all: The Waiau River communicates with our great western lakes. There are, besides, numerous large rivers which run into them from tho north. Thus our communications might stretch nearly to tho borders of Canterbury. I tlruk the ex plosive caohinations of our gay sceptics should by this time begin to die away into a very feeble whine indeed. So much for growing timber. But the stream of tho Waiau runs rapidly to the sea, offering splendid facili ties for water power, either for sawmills or any other purpose. I would not be understood to say, however, that timber is our only icsource ; it may not be our principal one. If I mistake not, iv, was the lay of those Western Alps which overlook this district that Jed Sir Roderick Murchison and the late Kev. C. B. Clark, of Svdney, iu 1854 to predict that this country would bo found to Ise auriferous. Another thought -strikes me. Whence comes the gold which supplied the late beach diggings at Orcpuki? It is as fine as dour, thus bespeaking a long water-carriage. In my opinion, it is brought down by the Waiau ai-ut then cask ashore by tho waves. Therefore tho matrix should be found some way towards the head waters of that river. In any case wo know that gold is very widely distributed through the soils of tho country, it is extomely likely that other minerals will be found as well as gold. We know for certain that coal exists in several places of good quality, and traced for sovoual miles'. it: is superior to the Nightcaps coal, and equal; to tl;e Taylor Creek coal on the Waiau” (so®; report of Captain Hutton’s), and in largo quan- Ci likewise petrolum shale, a quantity of ''■'■•'nch was sent to-Professor Black, from which.-, splendid oil was extracted (see his report in your - issue of some few months ago). There is a very fine quarry, the stone from which is very suit able for building purposes, and would make ox— excllent tombstones, grindstones, &c. I will say.- no more abont the agricultural produce thero than that all those grand stretches of hills aad. dales where such magnificent timber now grows, other crops as magnificent of their, kind can bo made to grow, as well as on many a fertile plain, and sloping upland now clear of bush. No an ticipation-could be more sober aacl rational than that vast tracts, wheie now the huge limbs of tho woodland giants toss and ravo in-, the wintry blast, shall yet be covered with yellow corn,,, waving in. the autumn breeze, and these primi tive solitudes shall yet be vocal with.the lowing, of cattle and the busy souuds of agricultural in dustry.

Chapter II.,"Happy Ozarovna. 1 was an interesting and charac teristic group, the Klossstock household, with Ferrari and Losinskia^ guests, a few days before the year of Anna's betrothal to the young and learned Rabbi was ended. They sat round about the great stove after dinner, Klosstock in his brown gabardine, looking vener able and picturesque; the young Eabbi similarly attired but in black, a heavy signet ring upon the forefinger of his right hand, his face singularly handsome, with soft, dreamy, hazel eyes, a brown beard, not un like the beard which painters give to their imaginary portraits of Christ; Andrea Ferrari, the Italian Jew traveller, a shrewd, keen-looking man of middle height, with a watchful manner, a dark olive complexion, a straggling black beard and moustache, a low compact forehead, as much of his mouth as you could see denoting firmness of character, his hand strong and nervous, bony, almost claw-like, his dress of a far more artistic cut than the others, with a girdle of tanned leather, and of ample proportions, large enough and strong enough to carry treasures even more valuable than their weight in gold ; and hidden in his breast both knife jtnd pistol — for while Andrea could play the humble Jew, he knew also how to protect himself on occasion. . There had been times when he had found it useful — and his conscience took no affront at it — to pass himself off as a Christian citizen of Venice. He hated Russia with the intensity of an unforgiving nature ; his father, an inoffensive ptdlar in the land, having lost his life in a street brawl at the hands of a drunken crew of Moscow revellers, his mother falling a viotitn to grief at her husband's tfeath, Apart from these inducements to revenge, Andrea Ferrari had imbibed the doctrines and some of the hopes of the latest propa ganda of the Nihilists of Russia ; but this he '< kept a strict secret in his own breast, he well knowing that in Russia even a secret so well guarded as his sometimes gets out, not by open or private confession, but through a keenly interpreted look, a sudden interoga tion, or an ill-considered remark. The somewhat sinister expression of An drea's face, a habit he had of dropping his eyes, an introspective manner, was very much in contrast with the frank, open countenances of the host, the Rabbi, and the young girl who was not only known within the Pale of the Settlement as the Queen of the Ghetto, but outside the Jews' quarter as the good daughter of the Liberal Jew. Anna loved to hear Andrea Ferrari talk of his travels, and the Rabbi, by whose side she sat, an attentive listener to the general conversation, was also much interested in him. "" Tell Anna,"" said the Rabbi, ""of Venice ; of those olden days of our people, and how our brethren have progressed in wealth, in power, and in freedom ; moreover, such ad vancement is an encouragement for hope, even here in Russia."" "" Would to God that all our neighbours, far and near,"" said Klosstock, lighting his big German pipe, "" were as well considered and as justly protected in their rights as we of Caarovna ! "" "" Rights 1"" exclaimed Andrea, in a fierce but suppressed tone, ""what rights, my father 1 "" "" The right to live without being beaten ; the right to pray to the God of our fathers ; the right to buy and sell."" ""Yes, we are well off at Czarovna,"" re marked the Rabbi ; "" but that should not make us content when our brethren in the east and west are ground under the heel, beaten in the streets, cast into prison, cruci fied ; and even here in the south, Czarovna is one of the few exceptions, where we may do more than herd together like animals con tent to feed on the husks their masters fling to them. But it was so in Venice, where to day our brethren hold up their heads in the blessed sun, and walk with the Christian merchants, their equals in respect and in power."" "" Not quite that,"" said Andrea, "" bub of a sufficient freedom of action and life ; it is only in London where it may be said the Jew is equal to the Christian. And if it were not that some of our brethren, steeped in the prejudices and vices that have been engendered of a thousand years of persecu tion, did not trespass upon the English liberal and humane sentiment by ill acts that we as a community would be the first our selves to punish, London would come to for get entirely that a man were Jew or Gentile, except if he were a Jew, to glorify him all the more for his good works. It is thus that we are cursed from generation to generation ; the offspring of the dead, bitter past, the child of persecution, the seed of misery and dependence, waxes strong, and in his strength develops the cunning of a past in which it was his only weapon, and brings down upon individual the curses of even the great liberal-minded people of London."" ""If thou wert not a Jew, and true as the ring of thine own gold, Andrea Ferrari, thy words would be thine own condemnation; but, friend of many countries, do thou tell our daughter Anna of that city of the sea, which is like the dream of a poet rather than a sober incident, from the book of real experience; and whither our dear son the Rabbi doth propose to travel with our loving daughter Anna — mayhap accompanied by their father— what sayest thou, Anna ? "" "" It is too much happiness to think upon,"" she replied. "" You may go to bed, Amos Negrusz,"" said Klosstock, addressing a serving man, whom both the Rabbi and Ferrari had eyed' with something like suspicion. The man bowed, but said nothing, not even "" Good-night."" He was a sinister-looking person, and had probably noticed a certain watchfulness on the part of the guests that was peculiar to their manner on this occasion, for though he had only been in the Jew Klosstock's service a few weeks he had come with sucb excel; lent credentials, and was so willing and so anxious to all appearance tc please, that both the Rabbi and the master were inclined to trust him, and to regard him as an acquisi tion to the household. "" Forgive me,"" said the Rabbi, lifting the heavy curtain over the door whence Amos Negrusz had disappeared, and standing for a moment in a listening attitude, "" and I will explain later."" Klosstock looked inquiringly at his daughter, whose hand seeking his, he raised it to his lip?, and she laid her head upon his shoulder. "" I do not like the man, Amos,"" said the Rabbi in a low voice. "" Nor do I,"" added Ferrari. "" Nay, what has the poor fellow done ? "" asked Klosstock. "" You thought him a good man and useful, my son, until now."" "" I did,"" said the Rabbi. ""It is only to day that I doubt him ; only to-night that I fear him."" "" Fear him ! "" said Klosstock. ""Do I hear aright ? "" ""Where did he come from 7"" asked the Italian. "" From Elizabethgrad,"" said Klosstock. "" Recommended by one worthy of trust 1 "" "" Yes, truly,"" replied Klosstock, "" the mer chant Chane."" "" I thought so,"" said Ferrari significantly. "" Do you know the merchant Chane ? "" ""Not to speak with him,"" said Klosstock, ""but I know him by repute as one whose word is his bond, and who has large posses sions."" ""Ha!"" ejaculated the Italian, rising and pacing the room for a moment, and at the same time pausing near the door, as if he listened for footsteps. "" Do you. know him ?"" asked the Rabbi. "" I do,"" said Ferrari. "" I fear a cloud is gathering about us,"" said the Rabbi, "" but one which may break far away if we are careful. I have kept watch over my words this evening that your servant might not hear of the warnings which have reached me within the last few hours from a trusted friend in St, Petersburg."" ""Is it toubbing the new. Governor ? "" said, Ferrari, interrupting him. ■^k%"" said the Rabbi. ""AlaSt I can. endorse ft • and I, top, hava j observed a reticent demeanour, for the reason that this Amos is not what he represents himself to be."" •'Forewarned is forearmed,"" said the Rabbi. "" The new Governor is on his way to Czarovna; it may be possible to propitiate him ; I know that it is possible for him to reduce. our lives to the miserable level of those of our brethren at Kiew. That we are an exception is due to exceptional causes. The hand of persecution lies heavy on our brethren all round about us."" ""Our brethren are themselves- much to blame,"" said Klosstock. "" They make hard bargains ; they thrive on the Christian need ; they do no acts of charity outside the Pale of Settlement; they forget that God made us all."" "" They remember,"" said Ferrari, "" that the Christian has ground them beneath his heel ; they remember that from age to age in all countries they have been harried by Chris tian fire and sword ; and that even in these days of so-called charity and education, and especially in this land of the Czar, they are the victims of harsh laws ; aliens alike from freedom and justice, and compelled to kiss the rod that stripes them. No, my father, blame them not that they take their re venge."" ""But I do blame them, my son,"" said Klosstock, "" and I present to them and to you the example of Czarovna as proof of the good that comes out of toleration."" "" Toleration 1 "" exclaimed the Italian, but in a hoarse whisper. "" The merchant Chano is a tolerant man. Hush I But we alarm our good young hostess,"" "" I have spoken something of this to Anna already,"" said the Rabbi, "" and we are accus tomed to discuss many things outside the ordinary lines of education."" Anna crept closer to her father's side, and looked up wistfully at the handsome young savant who was to be her husband within the next few days, and whom she loved with the devotion of her fervent and affectionate nature.",Fiction

He has a pretty little farm, a pretty little house j He has a loving wife within, as quiet as a mouse ; His children play around the door, their father’s heart to charm, Looking just as neat and tidy as the tidy little farm. No weeds are in the cornfield, no thistles in the oats; The horses show good keeping by their fine and glossy coats; The cows within the meadow, resting ’neath the beechen shade, Learn all their gentle manner from a gentle milking maid. Within the field on Saturday, he leaves no cradled grain To be gathered on the morrow for fear of coming rain ; He lives in joy and gladness, and happy are his days; He keeps the Sabbath holy; his children learn his ways. He never had a lawsuit to take him to the town, For the very simple reason there are no fences down; The bar-room in the village forjhim has not a charm; I can always,find my neighbor'on’his forty acre farm. His acres are so few that he ploughs them very deep; ’Tis his own hands that turn the sod, ’tis his own hands that reap ; He has a place for everything, and every thing in its place; The snnshine smiles upon his Helds, con tentment on his face.

Alter ho had eaten his supper, he went back to her loomand related all that bad transpired during the day. Of course the incident that had happened on tho moun tain road wai the most important of any thing to him, and lie grew quite eloquent over it. "" And the strangest of all, '^unt Audrey.""' he paid, whon he had told her about the huge snake and the frightened horse, "" was, that the gentleman seemed to know you "" ""To know me ' Why, who -was he ?"" ""Mr -well, I thought I couli remember his name ; but I havo his card somewhere He asked me who 1 was, and vhen I told him, ho eaid he used to know some peopie by the name of Waldemar, and asked if A.»iss Audrey Waldemar was a relative of mine. I told him you were my aunt. He gave a great ptarfc at that, and asked, in a queer tone— not quite natural, j*ou know it you were well."" ••That was strange,"" Audrey replied, look startled herself now. ""Find his card. Rich, «o thatl may know his name."" ""It is in one of my pockets,"" he re turned, beginning to hunt for it. "" Any how, he called the lady Ida, and she called him Arthur. Yes, here is the card, and it is such a nice-sounding name—' Arthur M. Halstend.' "" Audrey's face was as white as snow a=? she reached forih her hand and took that little piece of pasteboard from him. She read the name -that name which had never passed her lips «inco the day when she had given him up tor ever, but which had been treasured so sacredly in her heart during all the long years ot their separation. Then her hand dropned nervelessly upon her lap, and she lay bark in her chair, so still that Rich looked up at her wonderingly. ' Is your head bad again, Aunt Audrey ? ' he a^ked, frightened at her extreme pallor. ""It does not feel quite right. Please get me some water, Rich,"" she murmured faintly. He sprang to do her bidding ; but when he came back to her with it, he found that she had fainted dead away. He railed Mr-i Allen, in terror, as she was almost as much alarmed as ho ; but upon applying restora tives, Audrey soon recovered consciousness, though she lay for a long time afterward looking very ill and miserable. Later in the evening she seemed more like herself, and said to Rich : ""My fainting turn interrupted your story, dear. I want to hear more. Tell me about the lady — describe her to me."" Rich regarded her curiously. Fe could n^t help thinking it strange that the gentleman should have manifested so much emotion upon hearing her name, and that she, too, should have been so over come upon loarning about him. But he answered : ""She had black hair, and such lovely dark eyes— thoy were so beautiful, only vory sad. Her face was thin and very white, as though she had been sick a long time ; and then she had such a sweet gentle way, and spoke so kind to me. Aunt Audrey, I think, next to you, she is the loveliest lady I have ever seen."" ""And he —the gentleman — what was he like ?"" Audrey asked with averted eyes. "" He was tall and lai'ge with brown hair and eyes, and very handsome ; but he had a kind of grave way that made me a little shy of him, though he was very Iqnd apd gentle with his wife "" Audrey's lips quivered, and a sigh broke from them 5 bu,t Rich did not seem to heed it. ""They had a splendii horse,"" he went on, with animation. ""I think it was the finest one I have ever seen, and he looked po grand when he reared upon his hind feet and pricked up those silky ears of his. But where did you ever meet this Mr Hal stead, Aunt Audrey ?"" he suddenly ques tioned, remembeiing that she had not yet acknowledged the acquaintanceship. Audrey hesitated. Should she tell the boy that sad story of her life? He was wise and considerate be yond his years, and his tenderest sympathies would be hers. But somehow she shrank from giving voice to it. Some time she meant to tell him all about it ; to-night, however, she did not feel quite equal to it ; her strencth had alroady been'severely taxed by learning that her old-time lover had teen sp near her. So she merely answered : ""When I was a young girl, and my parents were living, I spent a few weeks in New York, and went a good deal into society, and I am quite sure that this Mr Arthur Halstead is the same gentleman whom I met at that time. I afterwards heard of his marriage to Miss Ida Mont rose, but I have never seenjhim since. I am very glad, however, that you lent them such manly assistance to-day 3 and J am glad, too, that they kiiow you are my boy/ she concluded, fondly. ""Now, 5*5 * she added, after a moment of silence, "" I am going to send you away ; for I wish to get all the rest I can, so as to be fresh again to-morrow morning. Good night, Rioh ; you are such a coinfo^ to me."" She drew him down, tp her and kissed him on his and forehead, and then, with a smile, and a fond pat on his cheek, phe sent him down stairs to Mrs. A^len, who, she said must bo lonely. But as s=or<n as the door closed after him sho buried her face in her pillow, with a hearl -broken sob. "" 'So near and yet so far,' "" she mur mured ; "" I cannot, bear it even now, after all these long years ; and if it wero not for that dear boy the future would seem almost unendurable to me "" She still had the card which Rich had given her, and, laying it beneath her cheek, she fell to sobbing as if her heart were breaking. "" I am weak, weak,"" she cried, ""to love a man who is the husband of another ; but I cannot help it— l gaye 1 myself to him for all time in those sweet old days. Oh, Arthur ! Arthur ! we made a life-long mis take— or, rather, I made a great mistake ; I never should have yielded to papa ; I ought to have considered our mutual happx ness, and not tried to right one wr®ng by committing another. Yet it is folly and weakness to grieve so wildly at this late day."" But Audrey Waldemar was not a weak woman, notwithstanding she had broken down so completely upon learning that Arthur Halatead had been so near her that day. Sho fought her grief out by herself— fought with her regrets, hor longings, and her undying love, until she gained the vic tory and came down from her chamber the next morning her own lovely self once more. She was a trifle paler than usual, but as sweet and calm as if no tempest of grief had swept over her, bowing her proud spirit to the very earth. But the peaceful quiet and the enjoyment of thai, mountain retreat wa9 over for her ; a strange restlessness took possession of her, and only a few days later she informed Mrs Allen that s?he had decided, after all, to act upon her suggestion and take a trip up through the Canadas, and then return to New York, Accordingly, a week from the very day on which Rich uiofc Arthur Halstead and his invalid wife, they left the green hills of Ver mont, and turned their steps still further north. They proceeded to Quebec, where they spent two or three days, then took a steamer up the St. Lawrence to Montreal. On the steamer they found a large com pany of touri-ts, and among them Audrey was delighted to meet a couple of friends, who were travelling with a party of young people about Rich's age or a little older. 1 here were four young ladies from four teen to eighteen, and two lads fifteen and sixteen, and they were as gay and happy as it is possible lor young people to bo. ""It will be fo nice for Uich,"" Audrey said to Mrs Allen, "" for he has never had much society, and I shall accept Mr 3 Campbells invitation to join their party ; their plans are very nearly the same as ours, and it will bo pleaeanter for us all "" There were also on board the steamer two characters who afforded considerable amusement to tho more esthetic pleasure seekers about them. There were Mr George Washington Starkey and Miss Martha Ann Starkey, of Starkeyville, Maine. The former was about fifty years of age. He was tall and laige of frame, with an awkward manner and gait. His face was very plain, bnt expressive of boundless good nature, and he had a scant supply of hair and no beard. His dress consisted of a pair of light trousers, a long-tailed black coat and vest, a stand up collar, and a tall hat. His sister resembled him very much in face and feature, although her manner was less awkward, and there was an intelligent expression in her mild grey eyes that was lacking in his. Her figure was very prim and extremely neat in her steel-grey travelling suit, which was cut in the fashion of twenty years previous ; a bonnet whose shape must have borne the aaine date, and a mantle trimmed with that old bullion fiinge such as our grandmothers used to wear "" She also wore a spotless kerchief about her neck, pinned with a huge broach pet with a gieat yellow stone, and black silk mitts without any fingers. She wore her side hair in corkscrew curls, so small and floxible that they reminded one of alder tas^ols constantly swaying in tne wind ; but sho had, withal, a pleasant face, a genial smile, and the kindest eyes in the world. She was proverbially industrious, being constantly employed upon a blue woollen stocking, through which she made her bright steel needles click and fly as if her entire support depended upon her occupa tion. This original couple were ""out for a summer tower,"" as Mr George Washington Starkey coniidentally informed a chance acquaintance; while "" Marthy Ann "" was his hobby, and, according to his honest belief, the most wonderful woman the earth possessed li She ain't so genteel, p'r'haps, as she might be,"" he remarked upon one occasion, but bending an affectionato glance upon the prim spinster, who was apparently oblivious to everything save her knitting, "" nor so sweet and purty to look at as some of them young blossoms over yonder,"" with a half wondering, wholly delighted glanco at Miss olrace Campbell, who was the acknowledged beauty of the whole company ; - ""she never was ; but,"" impressively, sho's good through and through. There ain't nothing she don t know about sickness, and yarbs, and medi cines, and nothing she wouldn't do for any body that was sick. She's a great hand to give to the church and missions, and she'll cook and buy all manner of dainties for sick folks, and work till she's ready to drop for anybody in a tight place. I tell you, sir, when Marthy Ann dies the world'll lose a stunner."" ""Have you and your sister always lived together ?"" he was asked, after one of. these dissertations. i "" Yes. When the old folks died, we was all there was lejl, and it seemed kind o' natural for us to'hang together. It's been a capital thing for me, and we've had quite a comfortable kind of a life. But it's been a pretty quiet one, and so we thought, as long as we could as well as not, we'd start out on a little tower for a change, and we mean to see considerable of th^ world, before we die. "" As may be supposed, this original couple created, no small amount of merriment among the more worldly wise people into whoae society they were thus thrown. Miss Grace Campbell, who was a thought less merry sprite, with two or three of her friends, could not always be restrained, and they bubbled over with fun and je?t at the quaint manners and sayings of their ""down liast "" companions. One morning they we^e ali assembled upon the deck of. the steamer and in a wonderfully merry mood. Their arrows were flying thick and faßt among themselves, when Miss Starkey came up from the saloon, knitting in hand, and immediately became a target for them to shoot at. She seated herse^ near tho joyous groop, a quiet errjilepn her lips, a look of enjoy* ment in her mild eyes, as if the sight of such pretty young faqes. wa.§ a great plea sure to her. "" Now\ we^l Hv& snch fun !"" whispered imprjlsiyo Grace Campbell. "" I'll quiz her upmercifulljy about those endless stockings, and W\\ b§ as good as a play.,"" Half an hour parsed, and Grace again 1 made her appeal ance before Miss Starkey,. with the grave faco of a penitent, ft he made a sincere apology, and was as sincerely forgiven, '* You were a tiifle thoughtless, peihaps,"" said the old maid, ""andM«rthy Ann Starkey never lays any ill-will against anybody, least of all against a pretty little innocent like you. "" She pufc up her hand and patted Grace softly on the shoulder as she spoke. ""Thank you, Miss Starkey,"" Grace re turned, the shadows all gone from her lovely face now that the ordeal was so coni tortably over; ""and will you lot me give you this ? it is a little silk piu-eo that I crocheted for mamma's birthday ; but I can easily make another before that comes, and I would like you to have it. Not be cause,"" she added hastily and colouring, "" I think it will make up for anything, but becauHO I shall teel that you are really friendly with me if you will take and use it,"" and she put a lovely little seal-brown purse with silver claeps into Miss Starkey's hands as she cea?ed ypeaking. The woman's lips quivered. It waseeldom that any one had given her a keepsake during her monotonous life, and thia pretty little trifle, tendered so modestly by the beautiful girl, touched her to the heart. *' Of course, I'll take it, dear, and thank you kindly, too,"" ehe said, in a tone that was not exactly steady, "" and— and I'll send you a pair of nice mittens, as soon as ever I can knit them.""

There was the name in the same bold, clerkly hand, which was by this time familiar to him, both in the letters and on the page of the travellers' book ; and beneath it, in the same writing but less firm, as if the fingers which had traced it had trembled with emotion or from weakness, appeared the sentence — ""Given by him to Rudolf Reutersfelt, April 2, 18—"" And still lower in quite another cahgraphy, the words— "" In Memoriam."" Clement gazed upon the open sheet like one in a dream, until the priest, touching his arm, said: "" Will you come to supper, now 7 Canine has called us twice."" His guest started violently as it suddenly awakened from a dream. "" Tim book I Whose was it 1 Where did you get it?"" "" From the Englishman I told you of. He who fell over the cliff. He was ill for some time here, and it was here that he . But come and have your supper first ; and I will tell you the whole story afterward, now you must be tired and hungry, and it is not well to keep Carline waiting. When the supper is spoiled she gets angry."" , Clement had no johoice but to obey, and yet despite his habitual self-command no meal had ever appeared to him so long and so tedious. The supper was served in the kitchen, ac cordingtothe primitive habitsof themountain and Garline and the guide both occupied seats at the table, the latter especially not failing to do justice to the good things pro vided. Again and again, the Cur 6 pressed his puesti to eat, and with hospitable insistance piled Clement's plate with all the delicacies which the mountain larder provided; and the baro net, who was much exhausted by the events of this most trying day, tried to swallow a few mouthfnls, though each one seemed to choke him. At last the host seeing that it was vain to urge him further, pushed his own plate away and said : "" Put the things away, Carline, and pre pare beds for Pierre and this gentlemen."" Carline nodded, and when the direction had been repeated in a louder tone said, looking towards Clement : "" Shall I put him in the room where the young Englishman "" "" No,"" interrupted the priest quickly and loudly. ""No, put Pierre there and this gentleman in the little room."" "" But the other is more comfortable,"" ob jected Carline.  ""IS ever mind ; do as I have told you ; "" and then turning to the baronet he continued in a lower key. "" These old servants are very obstinate and always want a reason for ever thing."" If Clement had not been so fully occupied with his own thoughts he would have de tected a certain nervousness in the priest's manner as he said these words, which called for some apology or explanation ; but he no ticed nothing peculiar. "" It does not matter where you .put me,"" he said absently ; "" anywhere you like."" "" Very well, in the little .room then ; see to it. Carline, for this gentleman, and, I fire going to smoke a pipe in the study, and you, Pierre, can remain here and do the same if you choose.""^ • ' . . T. „ | "" With your reverance s permission I shall go to bed at once,"" said the guide in his usually impassive manner, and having re ceived a ready consent he followed Carline from the room. The Cure"" looked after him for a mo ment. ""He is a strange fellow, that Pierre Mal voisin. I could tell you some queer tales about him — more queer than pleasant. And now, shall we go back to my room 1 "" ' "" If you please."" The change was soon effected. Eeuters felt closed the door and stirred the fire of pine conas into a pleasant blaze. "" It is always cold here at night,"" he, re marked, ""especially after a storm;"" and' instead of seating himself as Clement had done, he walked restlessly from one side of the room to the other with an uneasy move ment like a man who, having an uncongenial task b,eforo him, postpones its execution as long as possible. At last he paused in front of his companion and said abruptly, "" I wish you would tell me why you have come here. i have a strange suspicion which seems too foolish to be true. But I should feel very grateful iffyou would confirm ib or set it at rest."" "" I came here— to this house— by pure ac cident,"" said .Clement readily. "" A few hours ago I did not know that such a place existed. But I left England in search of that man,"" and he laid his hand upon the open page before him, and upon the name written there. "" ""Ah l l thought it. I knew it,"" muttered Eeutersfelt, resuming his irregular walk from side to side of the chamber. "" Why ? what do you know of me, or of my history 1 "" ""Of you? nothing, not even the name; but of him whom you seek, Rob "" ""Robert Clare?"" The priest behd3 his head affirmatively. "" I know something o£ him."" "" What ? Where is he 1 What has become of him 1 Pray sit down and answer me, you can scarcely imagine how you are distressing me by this delay. Where is Robert Clare?"" Thus appealed to the Cure"" knit his brows and turned his bright eyes on his new ac quaintance. "",It is a sad story,"" he said. ""He has got into some fresh scrape,"" thought Clement, ""and he has made the priest his confidant ;"" then he added aloud, 11 Never mind, tell me all about it. Indeed, I must know— l must find him, if I traverse the world over in the search."" "" You may even do so — you may search from pole to pole, but without success. You will never see >our friend again."" "" How I What ! Where is he ? What do you mean 1 "" Reutersfelt was silent, his eyes bent upon the ground. In his excitement Clement rose from his seat and confronted him. Strange doubts, fears, suspicions, coursed through his mind. The obvious explanation of the Curb's words never once suggested itself to him. He thought that Eobert had committed some crime. That he was in prison or perhaps in the galleys. "" Where is Eobert Clare 1 "" he cried. ""It is useless to try and hide this knowledge from me. I must know."" Like a fainted-hearted surgeon who wounds unwillingly and weakly, Eeutersfelt dropped his voice and murmured : ""He is dead."" ""Dead!"" If a thunderbolt had fallen at Clement's side— if the earth had suddenly opened her mouth and yawned^at his feet — if all things improbable, unnatural, and strange could have presented themselves before him at once it could not have astonished him more than the utterance of that one word. "" Dead."" "" It is impossible,"" he cried. Reutersfelt started. There was astonish ment, doubt, almost exultation in his tone, but not a vestige of sorrow. "" Are you not his brother 1 "" asked the priest. | ""His brother! Eobert Clare's brother? No ; he has no brother. But what of him self 1 Is it true ? Is he really dead ? "" "" Alas ! it is but too true ; he died in my arms more than two years ago."" Clement sank back upon his seat, and put his hand to his throat as if he were choking. ""Tell me— tell me."" "" I have told you too much already, and too suddenly. What a fool I am,"" cried the other, much distressed. "" I meant to break it to you— l tried to do so, but somehow I could not."" "" Never mind. Tell me all. Tell me all."" "" There is nob much to tell. Your friend came to the mountains with a hunting party. In following a chamois he was parted from his companions, and deceived by the thick snow he followed the creature to the edge of the precipice, and making a false step slipped and fell."" A shudder ran through Clement's frame, and he could not but remember how narrowly he himself had escaped the same fate. "" Ah ! you shudder, 1 ' said Eeutersfelt. "" You remember the spot ; it was there that he fell."" "" But he. You said once that he was not dead when you found him."" "" Neither was he ; the snow had broken his fall, and Fid6le found him at the foot of the precipice beside the dead chamois. He was, however, fearfully injured ; too much so to live, as I knew the first moment that I saw him. For, of course, Fid6le came at once to fetch me, and I knew from his manner that he had found something. I followed him, and discovered Robert Clare at the foot of the cliff. He had fainted, and lay' like one dead in a pool of his own blood ; his fair hair half buried in a mass of snow which had fallen with him, and his face fearfully bruised and injured, and soiled wtyh bjppjl and earth,"" Reutersfelt hesitated, fov a moment, and a stifled groan burst from Clement's lips. "" Carline and 1 carried him here between us, not without difficulty, for he was a tall, strong young fellow, and the movement in creased bis .agony so much that he woke from his stupor, and entreated us more than once to leave him alone, and let him die where, he was. It was then that I perceived him to be an Englishman, for his first words were in that language, but afterwards he generally spoke & Fwnoh, with 'tffcioK b$ seemed tolerably familiar. Of course we did not heed his request, but brought him on, and put him in a comfortable room, which I ' always keep ready for strangers. I then ! examined and dressed his wounds, and was confirmed in my impression that he could not ; live long."" "" And you told him so 1 "" "" Yes, I deemed it cruel kindness to try j and keep him in ignorance, so I told him j that he must prepare for death. He was quite resigned — I should say contented. For some days his sufferings were dreadful to witness, and my skill could do little to alleviate them, but his patience was extra ordinary. When, however, I praised him for it he would shake his head and say 'that all his life he had been impatient and rebellious; but for those faults he might have been living in a happy home ' instead of dying among strangers.' One day, when stronger than usual, he persisted on telling me his past history, flow he had fled from Eng land accused of a crime of which he was inno cent, leaving his young wife behind him in the power of those who had compassed his own exile, and that he had never heard from her since. ' I hope she is well and happy,' he said. 'If thought that my cowardly desertion had for ever embittered her life I could not die in peace.' "" "" • Would you not wish to write to her ? ' I I asked. ■ "" ' No,' he said, ' No ; for some reason or other she thinks that lam dead. lam sure of this, or she would have written ere now, and I will not disturb her peace. I only hope she may one day find in some true heart a love equal to that which I gave her, and a happiness which I could not give/ ""Another time -ib was on the day of his death — when mortification had set in and he suffered no longer, he called me to him and said: "" ♦ I wish I had taken your advice, Reuters felt. I wish I had written to her. Some thing tells me that she will suffer from my neglect, which heaven knows I meant in all kindness, but I am no longer able to hold a pen.' "" ' Let me write for you,' I said. "" • Thank you ; that will indeed be a kind ness. Tell her, then, that in my life I have been weak and foolish, but that in my death i lam happy ; that despite my faults I have always loved her and been true to her, and that my last prayer is that she may be happy and forget me '—here he paused and seemed quite overcome. "" ' Shall I write that 1 ' I asked. ""To-morrow, 1 he whispered faintly; 'To morrow. 1 11 But on the morrow he was dead."" Of Eobert Clare, as of King Charles I, it it might truly have been said that nothing in this life became him like the leaving of it, and when the account was ended Eeuters felt and Clement sat for awhile immovable and wrapped in painful thought, and then the baronet put his hand before his face and turned his head aside. He had no hard thoughts to repent of towards the dead man, no unjust deeds. Robert was gone from much inevitable pain and suffering, and his death had saved Clement and Ismay from a cruel parting, and bitter and undeserved shame; yet Clement's first feeling was of sorrow— almost of remorse, grief for the sudden extinction of that young, strong life^ and for the injury which he had so unoo'n sciously done him. But ere long brighter thoughts woke of Ismay, his love, and. now I indeed his wife. How he longed to fly fco her on the wings of the wind, and to clpjsp her again to his heart, never more to Vj&xt. He had no suspicion that even that Jnomenfc her life hung in the balance, and that neither doctor nor nurse bad any hope that she could survive the coming trial. A bright morning, fresh and fair as the dawn of the first day, broke over the Pyrenees, and woke Clement Dyer from his short and uneasy slumbers. He quickly rose and dressed himself, assuming the incon gruous garments which had been lent to him on the previous night, and hastened down stairs to jcin the priest, who was already noting in his garden the effect of the late storm. Reutersfelt advanced to meet his guest, and as he shook hands looked keenly into his face. "" The storm has passed from the valley, and methinks even your brow is less troubled than it was last night."" "" You are right,"" returned Clement, "" and you will not wonder when you know all."" "" Let us walk over the mountain,"" said his | host, "" and we can there talk unrestrainedly, but while breakfast is preparing I must in [ troduce you to my family,"" and he pointed with a smile to the waterfall which Clement had seen the previous nightj and which now shone like a stream of gold in the morning sunshine, while upon its rocky sides some dozen goats were climbing and browsing. The priest introduced them to his guest by name, and dilated upon their many and in dividual merits. The Englishman was in a mood to be pleased by all he saw, A great and dreadful weight had been lifted from his spirit, and the world and all it contained seemed more beautiful than it had ever done before. He did not rejoice in the news of Robert Clare's death, and yet it was not in human nature not to feel relieved by the knowledge which had lifted a great weight of anguish from his life and from the life of her whom he so fondly loved, Had Ismay 's love been Robert's he oould have grieved for her sake at his death ; but her love was his, and there fore he was thankful, not so much that her cousin was dead as that she was free. One fear alone troubled him : he felt too happy —what the Scots call '}* fey."" What if ;hi> news had 6ome too late ? and }$may were already in some way or ether beyond his reach ? He could not te\\ bow this might he, for he hftd. no suspicion ofthe truth, yet from time tp time an unusual dread- haunted him, and he could, not escape from it. He longed to return to England without another moment's unnecessary delay, and so set all doubts at rest. He theref oro asked Pierre to go at once in search of their mule and carriage, and see what could be done with both, as he wished to return to St. Girome, without delay. "" What I to-day 1 "" cried fievft, wlapse pipe was again in hjs tftou^h, and! who seemed, by no. iqean£ ansioup to leave his pleasant auarters. > * "" Yes, ifl'day,"" returned the Englishman decidedly, "" a*4 fyr every boi^' dsa£ tha£ you save I will pay you a day's wages,"" which noble offer expedited the guide's move ments in an extraordinary manner, causing him to apply at once to their' host for a ball of string, a hammer, and some nails. ""And what to do?"" said Reutersfelt quickly, for his attention had been engrossed during the last few moments by a domestic conference with Carline, in which the word ""dinner"" might have been beard more than once. "" What can you want with a hammer and nails 1"" Pierre explained that 'itjwas to repair their broken carriage. "" But you will not leavjj me to-day,"" said the Cur 6, turning to his guest. ""I must, indeed. Under other circum stances nothing would please me better than to trespass on your hospitality for a few days. During the morning I will tell ""you something of my story, and I think that you will then be as anxious to send me away as you now are to keep me."" "" It is indeed a strange tale,"" said Ren tersfelt some hours later when the two companions so strangely met paused in their walk to look down upon the valley at their feet, ""and strange are the working of. human passion; but for an old man's unnatural and undisciplined temper Hugto Clare would never have been slain, or his brother accused of a crime which drove him 1 , from his country."" ""So indeed it may seed to. us ; but wft o> knows why or wheijefor.e such things are per mitted ? In taia-wo^ld.', indeed, it is impossible to penetrate the causs of evil ; the problem is beyond us, especially that part which involves the suffering of innocent persons ; but often,, even here, we oan see the germs of good in things evil ; we oan see the perfected charac ter which has been refined in the fire, and where we cannot see this we must exercise our faith and argue from the known to the unknown."" ""And you think that all evil ends in good ? "" "" Yes, or I could not believe in a Divine* goodness that guides the world."" Reutersfelt nodded. ""Yes, that is true;"" and after a shortf silence he added, ""It is strange, but from, the first moment I saw you last night I thought you must be in some way conaected j with Robert Clare, that was the reason w}\y I did not tell you about him at once v'^ n I you asked me. I thought you wp' fo 'hi a j brother."" | "" That was because I was Engli' jn » "" No. It was something in •* J f ace . j ! cannob tell what, Ido not ?'

"" It should be ; and after all I cannot help thinking that his was one of those restless spirits to whom life would ever have been full of troubles, some at least of his own making ; and whose death in a sure hope should give us comfort rather than pain."" They resumed their walk in silence. After a while Clement said with an effort : "" In what month did Fid&le find Robert Clare?"" ""In March ; yes, somewhere about the end of March."" "" And he died 1 "" "" He died ori the 16th of April."" With a smothered ory Clement stood still and clasped his hands over his brow. "" She is then mine indeed."" Reutersfelt looked at his companion in amazement, but his wonder ceased when Clement explained to him how by a seeming accident his marriage had been postponed from the commencement to the 19th of that very month, and was, therefore, truly legal and binding. "" She is my wife in the sight of man, as well as in that of Heaven, and nothing on earth can part us now. No more shame, no more disgrace. She is mine— she has been mine all through."" His gratitude seemed too strong, too intense, for words. He knew by an unerring instinct how Ismay had cowered under the shame of her position, and now the shame was all gone | — sweptaway at one breath, and herinnocence ; in deed, as well as intention, made clear anci j manifest. No need now of a second mar riage, no possibility for scandal to point afe their past lives. She had been as free on the day she married him as if her first hus band had indeed been lost in the Atlantic two years before, or if she had never been married at all ; she was free then, and she was his now. ""A happy chance,"" some will say. But not so thought Clement. "" There is no such thing as ch,aaee,* he said reverently. ""It was Qod's special mercy."" And who shall dar§ >o, c^oubt it X The two men j^used on the mountain's brow and sijoafcty contemplated the scene below them. The storm had swept over the valley it is true, and many a, broksn shrub and up-> rooted tree betfayed its power, but the grass was washed to the pure, clearness of an emerald and tiie fiowere in fearless con fidence, lilted up their faces to the life-giv ing breeze. An overpoweringly sweet scent rose f.ro#i the pine wood, and the birds sang as if life were too short to give utterance to the whole of their praise. The storm had been, but it was over, and all Nature re joiced in its present calm and freshness- So, too, in the human heart, the tempest of trouble had swept wildly over it, rending and destroying its fairest blossoms ; but the devastation was not for ever. The same Omniscience had watched over all its creatures, rest and pea.oe had followed the storm both in the mountain valley and in the* hearts of those who Rooked upon it. "" A sto^m clears the air,"" said Reutersfelt $m#i»g, "" and this particular sfcorm has beeo a fortunate one for us.'* 11 For me, you mean. Yes ; indeed it has.. I am now only anxious to return' to England? with all speed, that I may set my darling's* heart at rest. • Every moment that intervene* tjefore we meet will be for her; a moment? o£ j*nd iox moae, qi. «uriety.!» . 10 "" True, and so I will not detain you, though I had hoped not to part so soon."" ""Shall we return now; it is time that Pierre was back."" ""In a moment ; but I have something to show you first."" And the speaker led the way, not into the valley which they had quilted in the morning, but by a slight detour to the left, into a ripple or combe, as they call it in Devonshire, where a small church of strong but not ungraceful con struction stood in a little nest of gx'eenery. Clement uttered some few words of ad miration, and the Cure said : « I had an object in bringing you here ; that you might obtain that which in your excitement you had apparently forgotten— the certificate of your friend's death,"" and then leading him into the quiet churchyard he showed him the spot where, over a grass grown grave, two young cypresses waved their ever-green branches, and two white rose trees shed their snowy blossoms on the turf. At the head stood a plain stone cross, bearing this inscription : "" In the memory of Eobkbt Clare, Who died April 10, 18-. H.1.P."" (To be continued.)",Fiction

Alter ho had eaten his supper, he went back to her loomand related all that bad transpired during the day. Of course the incident that had happened on tho moun tain road wai the most important of any thing to him, and lie grew quite eloquent over it. "" And the strangest of all, '^unt Audrey.""' he paid, whon he had told her about the huge snake and the frightened horse, "" was, that the gentleman seemed to know you "" ""To know me ' Why, who -was he ?"" ""Mr -well, I thought I couli remember his name ; but I havo his card somewhere He asked me who 1 was, and vhen I told him, ho eaid he used to know some peopie by the name of Waldemar, and asked if A.»iss Audrey Waldemar was a relative of mine. I told him you were my aunt. He gave a great ptarfc at that, and asked, in a queer tone— not quite natural, j*ou know it you were well."" ••That was strange,"" Audrey replied, look startled herself now. ""Find his card. Rich, «o thatl may know his name."" ""It is in one of my pockets,"" he re turned, beginning to hunt for it. "" Any how, he called the lady Ida, and she called him Arthur. Yes, here is the card, and it is such a nice-sounding name—' Arthur M. Halstend.' "" Audrey's face was as white as snow a=? she reached forih her hand and took that little piece of pasteboard from him. She read the name -that name which had never passed her lips «inco the day when she had given him up tor ever, but which had been treasured so sacredly in her heart during all the long years ot their separation. Then her hand dropned nervelessly upon her lap, and she lay bark in her chair, so still that Rich looked up at her wonderingly. ' Is your head bad again, Aunt Audrey ? ' he a^ked, frightened at her extreme pallor. ""It does not feel quite right. Please get me some water, Rich,"" she murmured faintly. He sprang to do her bidding ; but when he came back to her with it, he found that she had fainted dead away. He railed Mr-i Allen, in terror, as she was almost as much alarmed as ho ; but upon applying restora tives, Audrey soon recovered consciousness, though she lay for a long time afterward looking very ill and miserable. Later in the evening she seemed more like herself, and said to Rich : ""My fainting turn interrupted your story, dear. I want to hear more. Tell me about the lady — describe her to me."" Rich regarded her curiously. Fe could n^t help thinking it strange that the gentleman should have manifested so much emotion upon hearing her name, and that she, too, should have been so over come upon loarning about him. But he answered : ""She had black hair, and such lovely dark eyes— thoy were so beautiful, only vory sad. Her face was thin and very white, as though she had been sick a long time ; and then she had such a sweet gentle way, and spoke so kind to me. Aunt Audrey, I think, next to you, she is the loveliest lady I have ever seen."" ""And he —the gentleman — what was he like ?"" Audrey asked with averted eyes. "" He was tall and lai'ge with brown hair and eyes, and very handsome ; but he had a kind of grave way that made me a little shy of him, though he was very Iqnd apd gentle with his wife "" Audrey's lips quivered, and a sigh broke from them 5 bu,t Rich did not seem to heed it. ""They had a splendii horse,"" he went on, with animation. ""I think it was the finest one I have ever seen, and he looked po grand when he reared upon his hind feet and pricked up those silky ears of his. But where did you ever meet this Mr Hal stead, Aunt Audrey ?"" he suddenly ques tioned, remembeiing that she had not yet acknowledged the acquaintanceship. Audrey hesitated. Should she tell the boy that sad story of her life? He was wise and considerate be yond his years, and his tenderest sympathies would be hers. But somehow she shrank from giving voice to it. Some time she meant to tell him all about it ; to-night, however, she did not feel quite equal to it ; her strencth had alroady been'severely taxed by learning that her old-time lover had teen sp near her. So she merely answered : ""When I was a young girl, and my parents were living, I spent a few weeks in New York, and went a good deal into society, and I am quite sure that this Mr Arthur Halstead is the same gentleman whom I met at that time. I afterwards heard of his marriage to Miss Ida Mont rose, but I have never seenjhim since. I am very glad, however, that you lent them such manly assistance to-day 3 and J am glad, too, that they kiiow you are my boy/ she concluded, fondly. ""Now, 5*5 * she added, after a moment of silence, "" I am going to send you away ; for I wish to get all the rest I can, so as to be fresh again to-morrow morning. Good night, Rioh ; you are such a coinfo^ to me."" She drew him down, tp her and kissed him on his and forehead, and then, with a smile, and a fond pat on his cheek, phe sent him down stairs to Mrs. A^len, who, she said must bo lonely. But as s=or<n as the door closed after him sho buried her face in her pillow, with a hearl -broken sob. "" 'So near and yet so far,' "" she mur mured ; "" I cannot, bear it even now, after all these long years ; and if it wero not for that dear boy the future would seem almost unendurable to me "" She still had the card which Rich had given her, and, laying it beneath her cheek, she fell to sobbing as if her heart were breaking. "" I am weak, weak,"" she cried, ""to love a man who is the husband of another ; but I cannot help it— l gaye 1 myself to him for all time in those sweet old days. Oh, Arthur ! Arthur ! we made a life-long mis take— or, rather, I made a great mistake ; I never should have yielded to papa ; I ought to have considered our mutual happx ness, and not tried to right one wr®ng by committing another. Yet it is folly and weakness to grieve so wildly at this late day."" But Audrey Waldemar was not a weak woman, notwithstanding she had broken down so completely upon learning that Arthur Halatead had been so near her that day. Sho fought her grief out by herself— fought with her regrets, hor longings, and her undying love, until she gained the vic tory and came down from her chamber the next morning her own lovely self once more. She was a trifle paler than usual, but as sweet and calm as if no tempest of grief had swept over her, bowing her proud spirit to the very earth. But the peaceful quiet and the enjoyment of thai, mountain retreat wa9 over for her ; a strange restlessness took possession of her, and only a few days later she informed Mrs Allen that s?he had decided, after all, to act upon her suggestion and take a trip up through the Canadas, and then return to New York, Accordingly, a week from the very day on which Rich uiofc Arthur Halstead and his invalid wife, they left the green hills of Ver mont, and turned their steps still further north. They proceeded to Quebec, where they spent two or three days, then took a steamer up the St. Lawrence to Montreal. On the steamer they found a large com pany of touri-ts, and among them Audrey was delighted to meet a couple of friends, who were travelling with a party of young people about Rich's age or a little older. 1 here were four young ladies from four teen to eighteen, and two lads fifteen and sixteen, and they were as gay and happy as it is possible lor young people to bo. ""It will be fo nice for Uich,"" Audrey said to Mrs Allen, "" for he has never had much society, and I shall accept Mr 3 Campbells invitation to join their party ; their plans are very nearly the same as ours, and it will bo pleaeanter for us all "" There were also on board the steamer two characters who afforded considerable amusement to tho more esthetic pleasure seekers about them. There were Mr George Washington Starkey and Miss Martha Ann Starkey, of Starkeyville, Maine. The former was about fifty years of age. He was tall and laige of frame, with an awkward manner and gait. His face was very plain, bnt expressive of boundless good nature, and he had a scant supply of hair and no beard. His dress consisted of a pair of light trousers, a long-tailed black coat and vest, a stand up collar, and a tall hat. His sister resembled him very much in face and feature, although her manner was less awkward, and there was an intelligent expression in her mild grey eyes that was lacking in his. Her figure was very prim and extremely neat in her steel-grey travelling suit, which was cut in the fashion of twenty years previous ; a bonnet whose shape must have borne the aaine date, and a mantle trimmed with that old bullion fiinge such as our grandmothers used to wear "" She also wore a spotless kerchief about her neck, pinned with a huge broach pet with a gieat yellow stone, and black silk mitts without any fingers. She wore her side hair in corkscrew curls, so small and floxible that they reminded one of alder tas^ols constantly swaying in tne wind ; but sho had, withal, a pleasant face, a genial smile, and the kindest eyes in the world. She was proverbially industrious, being constantly employed upon a blue woollen stocking, through which she made her bright steel needles click and fly as if her entire support depended upon her occupa tion. This original couple were ""out for a summer tower,"" as Mr George Washington Starkey coniidentally informed a chance acquaintance; while "" Marthy Ann "" was his hobby, and, according to his honest belief, the most wonderful woman the earth possessed li She ain't so genteel, p'r'haps, as she might be,"" he remarked upon one occasion, but bending an affectionato glance upon the prim spinster, who was apparently oblivious to everything save her knitting, "" nor so sweet and purty to look at as some of them young blossoms over yonder,"" with a half wondering, wholly delighted glanco at Miss olrace Campbell, who was the acknowledged beauty of the whole company ; - ""she never was ; but,"" impressively, sho's good through and through. There ain't nothing she don t know about sickness, and yarbs, and medi cines, and nothing she wouldn't do for any body that was sick. She's a great hand to give to the church and missions, and she'll cook and buy all manner of dainties for sick folks, and work till she's ready to drop for anybody in a tight place. I tell you, sir, when Marthy Ann dies the world'll lose a stunner."" ""Have you and your sister always lived together ?"" he was asked, after one of. these dissertations. i "" Yes. When the old folks died, we was all there was lejl, and it seemed kind o' natural for us to'hang together. It's been a capital thing for me, and we've had quite a comfortable kind of a life. But it's been a pretty quiet one, and so we thought, as long as we could as well as not, we'd start out on a little tower for a change, and we mean to see considerable of th^ world, before we die. "" As may be supposed, this original couple created, no small amount of merriment among the more worldly wise people into whoae society they were thus thrown. Miss Grace Campbell, who was a thought less merry sprite, with two or three of her friends, could not always be restrained, and they bubbled over with fun and je?t at the quaint manners and sayings of their ""down liast "" companions. One morning they we^e ali assembled upon the deck of. the steamer and in a wonderfully merry mood. Their arrows were flying thick and faßt among themselves, when Miss Starkey came up from the saloon, knitting in hand, and immediately became a target for them to shoot at. She seated herse^ near tho joyous groop, a quiet errjilepn her lips, a look of enjoy* ment in her mild eyes, as if the sight of such pretty young faqes. wa.§ a great plea sure to her. "" Now\ we^l Hv& snch fun !"" whispered imprjlsiyo Grace Campbell. "" I'll quiz her upmercifulljy about those endless stockings, and W\\ b§ as good as a play.,"" Half an hour parsed, and Grace again 1 made her appeal ance before Miss Starkey,. with the grave faco of a penitent, ft he made a sincere apology, and was as sincerely forgiven, '* You were a tiifle thoughtless, peihaps,"" said the old maid, ""andM«rthy Ann Starkey never lays any ill-will against anybody, least of all against a pretty little innocent like you. "" She pufc up her hand and patted Grace softly on the shoulder as she spoke. ""Thank you, Miss Starkey,"" Grace re turned, the shadows all gone from her lovely face now that the ordeal was so coni tortably over; ""and will you lot me give you this ? it is a little silk piu-eo that I crocheted for mamma's birthday ; but I can easily make another before that comes, and I would like you to have it. Not be cause,"" she added hastily and colouring, "" I think it will make up for anything, but becauHO I shall teel that you are really friendly with me if you will take and use it,"" and she put a lovely little seal-brown purse with silver claeps into Miss Starkey's hands as she cea?ed ypeaking. The woman's lips quivered. It waseeldom that any one had given her a keepsake during her monotonous life, and thia pretty little trifle, tendered so modestly by the beautiful girl, touched her to the heart. *' Of course, I'll take it, dear, and thank you kindly, too,"" ehe said, in a tone that was not exactly steady, "" and— and I'll send you a pair of nice mittens, as soon as ever I can knit them.""

Ho was a rare etory teller and we knew he had a good one coming. i Sportsmen all, excepting the old man, who was a prowling trapper, and "" dropped in '' upon us occasionally of eveuings to help out in the yarn telling, we were gathered round a camp fire in a picturesque location—a giant ledge beetling out into tho sky over a canyon of the Yosemite, while the famed valley lay far below.

Ho was a mysterious fellow, ttcifcurn and repr-1 ling, usually prowling around by himself, ami in camp as much alone os possible. But he was a good sportsman, knew the couutry, and was tolerated. He looked and acted somewhat like a man who had ouce been a gentleman, but who was hounded by a crime. We noticed tbat he always avoided those who were familiar with the valley. He wus of commanding appearance when not skulking, but hi-; face resembled stone in moonlight, and he had a, restless, evil eye ; he had but one, and it appeared to be stuck in tho head of a snake. 1 His part in the story-telling was the silent one of listening. And ho lay immediately be hind, almost touching, me. I could feel hia hot breath through my buckskin co»t '* Tbe scene o' the story} as them story fellers say,"" began Simpson, bis eyes fised on the fire, "" was right hyar on this ledge— a good place fur a tragedy. That old hut thar was Sy Dickerson's hOcne. It looked nice then, fur thar was a gaL»round. All around hyar wus a garden. Up thar among the trees phe had a swing. * Old Sy ' they useter call tho old feller, jist as they call me ' old Steve.' It looks like I wur christened that,"" said Simpson, with a chuckle. The man behind became visibly interested at*the mention of Dickerson's name, and fixed upon tho narrator a sudden stare, turning leaden pale in the dim light in which be lay. On Steve's forehead there was a rough, seam like scar that appeared to glisten, as the flicker ing light of the fire fell upon it, with a special fascination for him. I moved more closely to the lire, for the nigbt was becoming cold- where lie lay, despite his hot breath against my buck skin. I noticed that Simpson glanced as if inadvertently in my direction as he mentioned Dickerson, and that his fingers appeared to play with the trigger of his rifle. "" Right hyar on tbis ledge,"" repeated Steve, emphatically. ""Boys, do ' you young fellers b'lieva tbat tbis by&r canyon is ha'nted."" 1 "" YVhy, Steve,"" we exclaimed, in affected astonishment at tho question, "" you don't believe in spooks, do you ? "" "" Nary a spook,"" disclaimed Steve, stoutly. ' People what sees speerits gin'rally has 'em in a bottle. I b'lieve I'll take a look at one now,"" said Steve, as he drained a pocket flask.

"" There would very Boon b8 a settlement around if it were fresh water,"" answered Grey. As they rode cloae to U & steam Beemed to arise and there was a total absence of the vegetation that might be expected in such a place. Far as the eye oonld reach stretohed a vast expanse of clear-looking water; but a glance was sufficient to show how shallow it was. In places ripples marked the top 3 of mud banks just protruding above the surface and showing how rapidly the drying up process was going on. The watsr looked bo clear that Tranoweth ' could hardly bring himself to believe it was unfit for use, and he dismounted to satisfy himself. He had scarcely got within a dosen yardß of the edge when he Bank up to bis knees in • sort of impalpable oose. Nearer the water he cculd seo what appeared to be accumulations of pure salt, and he soon found ont that it was really inch. The sun aontinually playing on the shal low water evaporated it and left the salt behind. Finding that he would haTO to wade through such stuff, he was glad to beat a retreat, for the mud was semi-warm and not calculated to cool one. As the spot where they first struck the lake was not a suitable one for making the camp, the party skirted along in a nor therly direction until thoy came to a low •erub of what looked like a kind of salt bush. Here a halt was made and the same kind of arrangements made as before. The meat of the kangaroo and the wallaby was hung out in tha sun to dry, and the horses were allowed to crop the shrubs before mentioned. Thiß they did for a few minutes, when they seemed to become satis fied. A couple of hours afterwards the prospec tors saw with consternation that the horses were affected by their new food. They showed extreme restlessness and irritability, and gradually got worse. Everything possible was done to quieten them, but in vain. A sort of greenish froth exuded from their mombs, while their tongues lolled out in a helpless sort of way. Their eyes became bloodshot and filmed, and at last one of tho oimals broke away arid gallopped madly n the direction of the lake. In a few seconds it was followe 1 by the other 3, and, -o the consternation of the miners, all the animals floundered into the briny water! *nd appeared to drink copiously of the fatal j j lirl. , Grey looked at the scene with a set face, I And then broke the silence with the re i mark: i "" Our horses are lost, mates, and we will j led courage and skill to ourselves."" '> ' It was apparent to them that Grey spoke he truth. The shrubs must have been poisonous.and perhaps were of the same species a* thoEe which killed Captain Sturt's horses on one of his expeditions. ! Alter drinking deep draughts of the saline water the maddened horses plunged out fur- ' ther into the steaming lake. j The remorseless sun beat down vertically on the animals and the rays from the sur face met those falling and formed a blinding heat which nothing but a salamander could long withstand. Within two hours of the fatal plunge a'l •hat could be seen of the horses was their dead bodies Seating in the shallow mud and water. The four man looked on as men in a dream at the strange sight that was being enacted before them. They well knew that probably it was but a prelude to a greater tragedy, in which they would have to play she principal parts, Considering the way in which they must be, fully one hundred miles from Mulwa station, and in auoh weather, it was impro bable they could reach it. They had only a single day's supply of water, and it would take a week to reach the station on foot. The stock of provisions t?as ample, though it would ba difficult to transport it without the horss-i ; but water was of greater consequence than food in Bach woather. Trenoweth was the first to call his com paaions' attention to the situation. "" Thare is no time to ba lost, mates. What (a best to be dane?"" Joe Norton looked up aa he said : ""The best thing I see is to try and get back to the station. Wo ought to be able to taanago it."" "" Yas,"" answered Grsy, thoughtfully, "" it ia our only chance. We should be able to grj back in flvo clayu, and if we are lucky we sight manage. It might, iniieod, rain,"" ha added, looking up at the burning sky, as Shough to seek for hope there. "" Will we go riKht back now ?"" Tom Nor ton aaked, anxiously. ""No; it would be the worst thing we sonlddo. The heat would shrivel us up,"" repliod Grey.

For several hours the silence was unbro ken. Trenowetb, for a wonder, slept soundly, and the rest was of great assistance to bim. Notwithstanding the heat of the day, he slumbered on until aroused to help in pack ing the stores. He sprang to his feet quite cheerfully and fully refreshed, and looked with surprise on the worn-out appearance of bis mates, "" Why, its near sundown. How I most lave slept, he exclaimed. ""Yes; you have Blept well, my lad,"" replied Grey, sympathetically ; "" and will feel tha benefit of it tonight. I wish we all ■lid the same."" Activo prepartions were now made to start. The saddles and other harness were left behind as useless, and only the straps were used in the packing. Everything was put in the most convenient form, and any article not absolutely wanted in the journey was cast aside. Half an hour before sunset the party began to retrace their Bteps. They intended j doing a long march that night, in the hope of reaching the waterhole before it was too j iate. If they could get a single bucketful there it would save them, but it was exceedingly doubtful if they could even squeeze out that modicum of fluid. The distance was fully twenty miles, and the country was not easy to get over, but life or death depended on haste, and they kept up a good speed during the whole night. At daylight they found themselves within two milea of the desired place, and in less than an hour they reached it. The first thing they saw in the dried-up hole was a dead wallaby, that had apparent ly perished of thirst. This was not a pleasant introduction, but they did not despair. They took the animal out and at once began digging at the bottom, which was intersected by huge cracks in the baked earth. Although not more than forty hours had elapsed since they got water at the place, it was now as dry as the Desert of Sahara. Several feet deep they laboriously exca vated, but there was not the slightest indi cation of water. The ground was perfectly dry, for the hot air had penetrated the crevices and sucked every drop of moisture up. Still the prospectors worked on, for they all felt that their very lives depended on finding water. It was near noon when they abandoned ihe task as hopeless, every drop of moisture teaming to have shrank into the earth in terror of the hsat. The exertion of digging under such a sun caused an intolerable thirst to afflict the party. Though any one of them could have drunk the whole supply half a dozen times over, they had to be content with merely moist ening their lips. A draught was entirely out of the ques tion. All save one tent had been left behind and spreading this over some bushes the wearied men crept under it to remain until the sun yot low in the heavens. They tried to sleep; but, worn out as they were, they could not obtain the rest which wus bo necessary to keep up their strength. F..r a while they tossed restlessly about and then, as if by a common impulse, they rose and made arrangements to continue on their journey. Before going Trenoneth and Grey went and lookel down the well they had sunk to see if perhaps amiraclu.had taken place and water flowed in. It was aa dry as a hearthstone, and they turned bitterly away. Time was now of supreme importance, and it was agreed that they should travel day and night until exhaustion compelled them to rest. Strapping their loans on, another sip was doicd out, aud shey started about four o'clock in the afternoon. Grey advised them to take a piece of the acrub along with them and chew it, but it was found to be so Balty that it rattmr aggra vated than allayed their thirst. Through all the long night they went staggering on, and when morning broke they were on the great plain. A bait was called, for they felt they must have rest; and the wearied men could hardly oreot the sunshade. Then lips and tongues wera swollen and cracked, and in husky whispers it was decided to at once drink the remainder of the water. Some of it was being lost through evapo ration, and a frightful longing possessed the stricken travellers to quench the burning thirst which was devouring them aa if in a furnace. It was a pathetic sight to see Grey mea suring out the precious fluid in a small pan nikin, while, with eyes of terri'fio longing, Ilia tuatea watched him. The loader's loyalty to his comrades will be understood when it is said he reserved the smallest quantity for himself; and, as water carrier, he could at any time have drunk the contents of the bag. The homesopathic draught had a reviving influence on the men, who were able to eat a little food after it; and then, one after another, they tank into a wildly.fevered sleep. It did not last very long, however, for the heat was dreadful, and they awoke with bloodshot eyes and a . sensation of choking. Their finger nails seemed to be oracking off, and their hair felt brittle as glass. It was past noon when tbey awoke, and silently they took up their loads for another start. Witnout a word Grey took the lead, and under the full force of the pitileßS sun, they headed across the apparently interminable plain. Sunset came, and with it a slight cessa tion of the heat; and, with the energy of despair, the doomed prospector! struggled on. All that night the power of human endur ance was exemplified, for the monotonous tramp was kept up. Wban daylight came Trenoweth looked round :s if waking from a trance, for be had only two companion!. He looked bard at them to see who they were, and be recoguised in a dim sort of way that they were the brothers Norton. Grey waa missing, and Joe and Tom appeared to be quite unaware of it. Half dead as he wan, Edward could see that th(;re was a""-look in the eyes of the brotheis which aeemod strongly indicative of insanity. The swollen tongues and lips of the men refused speech, but by eigns it was decided to rest. Mechanically the shade was put up and the three eshairated travellers crept uader it. In a few rainntes Trenowetb. had fallen into a deep sleep, which held him in a tranoe for hours. With a Btart he awoke to fail misery, as night wsb falling on the earth, or that hor rible portion of it where he then was. He looked round in a dazed and stupid fashion, as if expecting to see others about bim ; but, save for a few buszing insects, he was alone. He staggered to hia feet and walked round the raised screen, but no human form met his wild eyes. He laughed to himself at his position. What an excellent joke it was to be left alone in such a placet How he would rally his comrades upon it when he saw them ? Yes, it was moat amusing to have suoh a trick played on him ; but, of oourse, it was only a joke. Ah 1 what about the water bag? Where was that? He mußt have a drink IHe recollected in a sort of plirenzy.as he dashed madly under the screen where it was usually kept. Groping on his hands and knees, he sought in vain, and in his search he scattered the contents of three swags which lay on the ground. In hia delirium he picked up a round tin containing preserved sheeps' toungues, and ; imagined it was full of water. ; ■ With eager haste he brought hia jack knife into use, and soon had the top of the tin of. Seising the tongues he slowly devoured them and also the jelly which was with them. They were very juicy, and ware grateful to his parched throat, for the soothing effect produced partly restored him to his seases. He again glanced round for bis companions, but not seeing them, commenced a search outside. Then, in a voice that was more like the croak of a raven, he called them by name, but no answer came. The echoes of the hoarse oall echoed over the desolate, parched plain, but t&ose called were as mute aB though Death had placed his hand upon them. It would have been merciful if he had thus saved them from an awful, lingering death by thirst. The Btars were shining out brightly in a cloudless sky, and Trenoweth looked up to them aB if in silent appeal for help and companionship. Then he stood like a statue for fully half an hour, until, as if rousing himself from a reverie, he went hurriedly back to the shelter and began doing up his swag. With curious canning, he carefully took with him half a dozen tins of the preserved tongues which lay about. Then, recollecting that night was march ing time, he Ballied out, leaving the shade as it was, and started off on hia lonely jour ney. He kept on at a rapid pace all night, and when morning came opened another of the tins and voraciously devoured the contents, although he almost choked himself in the act. About a mile to the east he could see a small clump of trees on the side of a conical shaped hill. Tuwards this he made and reached the grateful shade before the sun's rays became too strong. Aa be stood under one of the stunted euealypts and looked towards the summit of the hill.a keen desire possessed him to ascend it aud see if human habitation could be seen from it. He instantly acted on the idea and slowly began the toilsome ascent. It took him over an hour to gain the top, and when he did he saw he was on the edge of an extinct crater, which sank to a con siderable distance, As he looked into the abyss a fascination seized upon him, for far down below he could sure) j see water shining. Yes I It was no delusion I The crater held a small lake in its centre which could easily be reached. Who can describe the haste with which the suffering man descended to that which was more precious to him than all else upon earth. In a few minutes he was beaide the water and swallowing it as if he would drain the crater. It was a wonder that ha did not kill bim suit, for the water was totally unfit for human consumption, and he must, hare drunk a gallon. Nature, however, came to his relief and he gut sick; a fact which no doubt saved his life. Tue cool liquid, also, had an instantane ous effect on his blackened and swollen lips and tongue. In a few minutes they became soft and reduced in size ; and, creeping under the shaiiow of an overhanging pieao of lava, he again had recourse to the tongues. This time he ate them with a relish, and a few minutes afterwards he sank into a re freshing aieep. The sun, in its westerly course, pouring its rays on the slumbering wayfarer, awoke him from his strange bed. He got up refreshed, though with a heavy sense of his desperate position, and decided to take a. small drink of the vole ;nic water He filled the empty tin which lay beside bim and drank a few rnouthfuls. . It bad a moat unpaiateable taste; but a man in his position cared very little for such a trifle as that. After this he again filled the tin and then climbed up the crater to get another view of the surrounding country. In fact, he had seen nothing in the morn ing gave the water at the bottom of the crater, and once he bad realised its pretence he had wanted for nothing else. The day, though intensely hot, was clear, and Trenoweth got an excellent view. To the west lay a vast plain, which he had a dim recollection of crossing. In a southerly direction the country was also level, wbile to the north it was broken by a couple of small mounts. Easterly he could see a great rang* of hills stretching for many mile» and rising to a considerable altitude.

Wk left Dr. Goodwin and Miss Fitz gerald seated together on the deck of the 'Europa' in the Cove of Cork where the steamer lay at anchor wait ing for the Irish mail — the same mail that poor Gertrude had missed by just five minutes. It was now late in the afternoon and they had had Inncbeon and returned to the deck to gaze upon the same beautiful scene by sunset which they had first beheld by sunrise, j Gerald who had gone on shore in the morning had not yet come back. The Irish mail arrived at six o'clock. With this mail and with the last passengers Gerald returned to the ship. He did not approach Geraldine, but went directly down to his state-room. Half an hour afterwards the ship sailed. Dr. Goodwin and Miss Fitzgerald re • mained seated on the deck conversing j in a low toue, and gazing on the beauti ful shores of the "" Green Isie,"" in the > golden glory of the setting sun, and the silver radiance of the rising moon ; j for these luminaries were on the verge of the horizon at the same moment;! but the sun was setting behind the I we? tern hills of Ireland, and the moon was rising from the waters of the chan nel iv the east. The two friends sat there until the last light of the sun had faded out of the west and the rays of the moon were streaming down upon the sea. Then Gerald Fitzgerald joined them and stood leaning over the bulwarks looking far oat to sea. Dr. Goodwin on seeing his fellow passenger approach, arose and said : "" Now, that the colonel has made his appearance to look after you I will re tire my dear. lam rather susceptible of taking cold and the night air on the sea at this season is rather keen."" "" Oh, pray take care of yourself, Dr. Goodwin ! I had no idea that you felt the chili, or I would not have permitted you to stay hefe so long,"" said Ger aldine, quickly ; aud she thought that no experienced chaperone or manceuver ing mamma could have acted with more taot and discretion than this same venerable old Doctor of Divinity. But the truth is that Dr. Goodwiu was afraid of the night air and he had no ofcbei* reason for leaving the deck. He bowed and withdrew. "" Gerald, here is a seat. Do sit down,"" said Geraldine as soon as the old man was out of Bight. Colonel Fitzgerald turned bowed and took the place sho indicated. ""Gerald, what are you thinking about ?"" she inquired with solicitude "" I leg your pardon r"" said Colonel Fitzgearld, interrogatively as if be had not heard her. "" You are always dreaming Gerald. What are you dreaming of ?"" she earnestly inquired. "" Geraldine there is always a scene before my mind's eye tbafc I cannot banish if I would.

It is the scene of my wife's death beneath the waves of that red sea lighted up by the flames of the burning ship,"" he sadly and sternly replied. "" Gerald, this is morbid.

"" Geraldine, fifty men — ho, nor five men ever left their wives or mothers or children to perish as I left mine,"" he answered in bitter sorrow. ""Ob, Gerald ! Gerald ! Gerald ! my betrothed no longer but my dearest friend and cousin still ! You wrong yourself you do indeed ! You wrong yourself most cruelly ; You did not leave her to perish ! She was killed by an accidont before my very dyes ! I saw her killed before I called oat to you for help. It is an awfnl horrible thing to tell you and it was a more horrble thing to see, but I saw the back of her head crushed like au egg-shell by a blow from that plank yon struck out of toy haud ! I saw that sbe was' dead before I called for assistance ! And I bad a right to your assistance, Gerald, for you had inadvertently stricken my only support from under me and I was drowning by your act."" "" If I could ouly believe that, Geral dine, it might mitigate my remorse though it could not soothe my sorrow,"" be answered. "" Do you then presume to doubt my word ?"" "" Most certainly I do not doubt your veracity ; bat I may doubt the evidence of yonr senses as I should doubt that of my own,"" answered Colonel Fitzgerald. "" You are morbid, Gerald. Oh, that I could bring yon to a healthier frame of mind !"" "" Geraldine, do not tronble yourself with me. lam not worth your care,"" he answered moodily. "" Gerald ! I know of coarse that all is over between vs — that we never can be more than friends and cousins ; but stilt we are too near kin, too dear friends to make it possible for me to look upon your suffering and not suffer with you — to feel so helpless to help you and not—"" Here poor, proud Geraldine broke down and burst into tears — nay more ! j she dropped her head upon his shoulder and wept bitterly. * "" Let me lead you to your state-room, Geraldine ; you would be better there,"" said Colonel Fitzgerald, rising, and thus depriving her of- support on his shoulder. "" Thanks ! no sir, I do not need assist ance, — I need self-recollection more, for I have forgotteti myself, I think,"" she answered, haughtily, as sbe arose and walked off. Colonel Fitzgerald followed her to the head of the companion ladder, and saw her down into the ladies' cabin in safety, and then he returned to his seat, with distraction added to his sorrows. "" Poor girl ! I shall be glad for her sake, when this voyage is over,"" he said to himself; for it seemed to him then that the death of Gertrude had extinguished the last lingering spark of affection that he had left in his heart for Geraldine ; and that be loved Ger trude in her ocean grave more than he had ever loved Geraldine in all the pride of her life and beauty. Was he mistaken in himself ? Time will show. Their voyage across the Atlautic j passed without any event, except the snow storm that overtook thetu just as they were entering New York harbonr. This was the same snow storm in which the unfortunate captain of the 'Zanzi- \ bar,' then ou the Sand Bank of New. j foundland, lost his reckoning, and ran j upon the island of ice. But the 'Europa' j being three days ahead of the ' Zauzi- j bar,' was safe in the harbour of New York when the full force of the storm broke. The ship reached her pier about nine o'clock that night. Colonel I Fitzgerald, leaving Dr. Goodwin to look after Geraldine, and to get their baggage through * the custom-house, hastened to the railway-station of the New York and Washington lines, to ascertain when the first train would leave for the South.. Ho was told that the last train for that night had just started, and that there would not be another until six o'clock the next morning. He went back to the stearaev with the news, and then took his party to the old Astor House, as the most convenient for their purposes. ""Now, of course, I shall have to hasten down to Virginia with all possible expedition. I must leave by the first morning train for Washing ton, which starts at six o'clock,"" said Colonel Fitzgerald, as he seated him self at Hie small supper-table with his party in their private parlor in the hotel. "" But I need not hurry or in convenience you or Miss Fitzgerald. If you, or if Miss Fitzgerald should like to stop in New York for a few 1 days—"" "" I thank you, Gerald,"" interrupted his cousin ; "" I prefer to go directly home."" ""And so do I, Fitzgerald,"" added the good doctor. ""The very- same in terest that takes yon in such a hurry to Virginia, takes me also. I am 'as anxious to hear the communication of the dying- woman Magdala, or — what is her barbarous name, Cleu. Phara, as you can be."" "" Yes, but the woman declares that she will not divulge the secret to any one but me,"" objected Colonel Fitz gerald. ""If the question is a fair one, may I ask what you are both talking about?"" inquired Miss Fitzgerald. "" Yes, Geraldine, we are talking of that communication which the wander iug maniac whom veknew as Magdala, made to my fatler on his death bed "" "" Aud which was said to have accele rated his death ?"" 4 "" Yes ; the woman Magdala, or rather the gipsy Clea Phara, is now ori her death-bed, nnd wishes to make a clean breast of it to me."" "" This secret which she has boasted, if giveu to the public, would pull down the * unsoiled plume' of Fitzgerald to the dust r"" inquired Geraldine, with a sorrowful smile. . "" Yes, I suppose so !"" "" I defy her, ot any one else, to divulge anything which can do that ! And I am amused, Gerald, that you should be so credulous as to believe such a statement."" '* Yet you and I know that there is one sealed page in our family history."" "" You refer to Arthur Lloyd Fitz gerald, the son of your father's eldest brother ?"" "" Yes I refer to Author Lloyd Fitz gerald, my cousin."" ""Thatromantic Quixotic boy who had his head turned by reading piratical romances and who onghfc to have been well Hogged for his mad caper instead of being so handsomely and terribly punished as he was. But what has his face to do with the case under dis cussion ?"" "" It may have nothing to do with it ; it may have everything. Remember that nothing has ever been heard of the lad since his reckless escape from the sloop-of-war 'Samaria,' by jumping overboard at midnight."" "" But he was supposed to have been drowned then and there."" "" Yes, supposed but not ascertained to have been drowned. I confess that it seems to me that trouble can ouly come to the family through some circum stance connected with him."" ""Did you ever kno;v him Gerald ?"" ""No ; he was full fifteen years my senior.

And if the secret that the gipsy woman told Maurice Fitzgerald on his death bed had anything to do with the fate of Author Lloyd it is ro wonder that in his weak state it hurried him into his grave, for he never could bear the least allusion to that misguided and unhappy youth."" "" No ; I know that my uncle conld not endure to hear liis name mentioned. If we are to take the six o'clock morn ing train we must be up by half-past four.

The yacht was already a floating museum. Nine months previously the Yarra had left the port of Melooiirne for a cruise round the world. She had been built in Glisgow for her owner, Mr. Herbert Gifford, and was one of the finest ever turned out by the far-famed j firm that had constructed her, spped and , comfort being equally studied. She carried about thirty soul 3, the ov.'ner and las com panions included. Bho could steam vhen rc qaired, having a funnel that could b3 un shipped ; bat at present she had to rely upon I her sails, a<? the coal hvl given oufr. Indeed, the owner did not care about steam and ltn unromintic surroundings. The yacht had touched at most ot the places in Kew Zealand worth seeing, Milforo Sound andLitier Taopo and EDtomahrma bSncj ""done,"" and at Buenos Ayrca. The Stoaits of Magellan, with their wondrous scenery of snowclad moun tains, glaciers, and sounds, had been navi gated, and the trp-vcllers had seen most of what ia worth looking v at in Chili and Peru. Tahiti had been raiio from Callao, and in that lovely region tin? yachtsmen had stayed for a good period, leaving it with regret. They were now on their way to Hawaii, from •whence they intend x\ to follow the track of others and reach Jap*ui, their course after that being undecided. In two year 3 from the date of starting they were to lefcurn to Mel bourne. On a blight iridescent morning the owner of the yacht was standing on the deck, look ing at the lovely scene, and the play of color. The yacht iay becalmed romo distance from a dark, forbidding ishnd, piecipnous on eveiy side, indeed rising up to ngieat height. The navigators could not find this island in their map 3, though that cli 1 not p\cite their sur prise, as they were in the region marked "" Supposed Inlands."" Tnh island, so unlike all they had heretofore seen in these sunny seas, had appeared to them as the morning dawned. Heibert GifTord, the owner of the Yarra, was gazing upon it with an undefined longing to explore Jt, which seemed impossible. A splendid specimen of manhood this young fellow appeared, as he leaned that morning npon the bulwarks, attired in yachting dress, which showed off to the utmost advantage the physical grace, strength, and symmetry of his form. Ho was surrounded by a number of handsome youths n yachting dress, form ing a kind of Grecian picture. Oae charac teristic figure alono appeared in the group, a tall, thin, angular youn^ man, with a peculiar face, the expression of which was intensely comic, though not meant to be so. Happy, happy, lyoung men, wealthy, healthy, with nothing to do but enjoy themselves ! ""So you sly you -&w strange things last night,"" enquired Herbert Gifford of the queer looking youth. ""I did,"" was the reply, ""extraordinary lights in the sky and over the sea, just to wards morning. It secmod as if we had come into the land 0' Diableke.""

Instantly instrumonts wore produced, and upon the "" silenb sea"" burst a grand melody, interpreted by manly voices accompanied by violins and wind instruments.

It was a lovely autumn day, the sun was shining brightly, and the hum and movement of the streets were very pleasant. No reaction had come to him ; he was as determined as ever to show these men what he could do when the time came. He laughed as he thought how secure they felt themselves, and his heart swelled when he thought of his power and how he was about to put it to the best of uses, the avenging of the wronged. He had mapped the future of the bank out clearly, he knew what was to be done clearly. Not one of the directors had dreamt that the young man had not only grasped his own business, but that of the bank ; indeed, to understand one was to grasp the other, so closely were they related. "" They call me a madman,"" he murmured to himself, as he turned the corner and reaohed his carriage ; "" I will show them who is mad and foolish."" His foot was on the step — many had paused to look at this graceful, handsome youth, whose clothes so well showed off his fine, truly moulded figure, the beauty of whose face was heightened by the colour — when he was touched on the arm. Turning around, he saw it was a bank clerk, whose face plainly expressed wonderment. Indeed, the clerks were bursting with curiosity, and even the customers hovered round to get an inkling of what had taken place. The clerks were nearly all mere youths— when they got a certain age they either bettered themselves or were dismissed for asking an increase of salary — and since Herbert had joined they had grown to adore him. When they heard of his action in raising his own employes' wages, hope rose high in their hearts. They all declared he would try and better their lot, though they felt confident he could not carry a "" pill of relief."" When the hubbub in the directors' room had taken place, they all felt sure the dread moment had arrived, and the battle begun. How earnestly they hoped their young champion would beat down these obdurate men. "" Mr. Whinatun gave me this note,"" said the clerk ; ""it is for you, Bir."" 41 For me 1 "" said .Herbert, staggered. "" Surely not."" And^then, as if to contradict himself, he opened it and pulled out a little slip of paper, on which was written : "" I wish to see you on an urgent matter; not regarding my own but your affairs."" Herbert absolutely turned pale, and the crowd who had gathered, under pretence of studying the shop windows, to look athim, were delighted. Something was going to happen or had happened, and that always delights a crowd. The fact was that Herbert at first feared Whinstun, who had had great power with the bank and his father, had been guilty of defalcations, his estate being the sufferer, and that he now wanted to be shielded so as to, in his pwn way, have time to make the defalcations good. He dismissed this idea, however, when he recollected how severe had been the scrutiny of the securities and the money. He felt indisposed to excite himself again that day, and almost resolved not to see Whinstun. But, reflecting that this might be misconstruel, he changed his mind, j and walked into the bank. He passed through the crowd of customers and olerks, whose eyes devoured him and knocked at the manager's, door. A thin voice bade him enter. Mr. Whinstun stood, us was his custom when dealing with great cases,"" in front of ths fire. His face was Bet and ghastly, and he bent a malicious look upon his visitor. Herbert shuddered. Thus had this man stood when he had pronounced f hc'doom of many a belter man than he. The reflection nerved and made him firm as sfael. He looked full into the manager's ace. Whinßtnn's eyes fell before that hon°st j cornful look, and his head sank. Despite himself the terror had returned, and he had ■sought this interview to play a card which he knew would have done with tho father, t» whom he had often exhibited it, and which he thought would influence the san. "" Well,"" said Herbert in a harsher voice than would be thought possible, ""what do you want with me ? I tell you at once noth ing that you will say can alter my determina tion. Manager of thia bank you will not be, if I have tho power. The dead in their graves are crying for vengenee and they will have it."" Mr. Whinstun had resolved upon a different course, but now all the fury of his nature. . a nature uttterly unaccustomed to be thwarted, burst forth, and the man became absolutely a furious madman. He saw the i work of his life time about to be snatched from his grasp, the yawning chasm of destruc tion at his feet, and he became desperate. Herbert almost recoiled from him. "" You cannot do it, you cannot do it,"" he screamed or shrieked ; he could say no more ! and put his hand to his heart. I The people in the banking chamber were again electrified. "" Hush,"" Baid Herbert ; ""Do you want the bank to be alarmed ? "" 11 1 care nothing,"" cried the furious man who had now recovered his speech— he had always been a man of violent temper, but having never till now received a severe check he had done nothing notorious — "" Let them know. If lam to fall, let the house fall, the walla collapse, and the building crumble to the ground. Ha IHa ! I won't be the only one buried under the ruins ; even you, rich as you are, will not escape unhurt."" "" There is no need to protract this scene ; it will do no good ;"" said Herbert, recovering himself, and turning to the door. ""No; you must not go,"" cried the ma nager, springing forward and catching his arm ; "" not at leaßt until I say what I have sent for you to hear. I will be calm enough — see if you will."" Herbert shook off the hand, and stared at him firmly. There was no fear or flinching in his face. "" What,"" asked the manager, ""has led yon to take this step? What have I done to you? Did I not help to build up your fortune ? Was I not the right hand of your father ? Why, then, turn upon me?"" There was almost a pathos in his tone. "" Why do you ask me the question ?"" said Herbert. "" You know the answer well enough ; your own heart mu3t tell you. You have known for years that I looked upon you as I was taught by my mother, as not only a selfish, giasping man, but one who never hesitated at crime, though always keep ing within the law, and the worst of crimes are committed within the law — to obtain an advantage. You helped my father — to help ! yourself. He took you from the dirt, and every farthing you made you owed to him. Perhaps, cramped as his nature was, he would have become a better niaii, he would have yielded to the influences of his wife, had you not been his evil spirit, his counsellor. You want to know the rea a ona. They are many, but I will give you the leading ones. When I was a boy I resolved to depose you, if ever I had the power. I have ifc now, and I will exert it. My first reason is that you aie leading the bank to ruin. Another step and you would have it in your grasp. You would get it so involved in your affairs that sustain you it must, at all hazards. The position is not that yet. The bank can realise upon your securities."" ""My securities,"" cried the banker; ""the bank has not lent me a penny."" "" That will not do with me,"" eaid Herbert, sternly ; "" your name does not appear, for the money is lent to your partners, men of straw, but for you. The money would not have been advanced but for your power with the directors. You have played the game for many a year, and done well. You were not satisfied ; your greed would not let you rest. For some time you have been taking up pro perties in Queensland, South Australia, and West Australia. Men of experience whom I havo consulted pi edict a terrible failure, unless there is unlimited capital to fall back upon. That you will not get now. You have come to the beginning of the end. That is one reason. Do you remember Tom Hoi ton, who died in misery ; Tom Horton, who, but for you, would have now been the richest man in Australia ; to whom even I would have been but a small capitalist ? A man of warm, generous heart and impulsive nature ; whose hand was ever open, whom hundreds acknowledged as their benefactor, the man who gave them a start. Shrewd, for all that. But a great drought came, a drought that the wisest could not foresee and allow for. Then, when the bank of whom he had been a generous customer should have upheld him, it failed him, when, for the first time, he wanted help. Why? Because the wicked majority on the directorate saw if he were crushed they could buy his properties at a tenth the real value. They crushed the man ; they bought the properties; the drought passed away, as all knew it would — six months grace would have saved Tom Horton — and on these purchases thousands per cent, wore realised. Poor Tom Horton""— here Herbert's voice became low and his eyes clouded— ""how well I remember him. He was a constant visitor at our house, and when he was there he made even my father jovial and happy. He was a man who diffused sun shine wherever he went ; and you ruined him. You I I know that my father resisted the proposal to close upon Horton for some time. Even he was not bad enough to turn upon so good a friend. Bat he waa over borne. And what became of Tom Horton ? "" "" What became of many a man of his reck less class,"" replied the manager coldly ; ""he died of his own besetting sin, drink. The path of life is strewn with such wrecks. When a .man takes to drink he is beyond sal vation here or hereafter."" "" Yes,"" replied Herbert, "" when men like you abound. Tom Horton never recovered that terrible blow. He saw the work of an honest and laborious life cast to the winds at the word of men whom he had benefitledand and trusted. He saw his child left without a penny. He was of an age when to begin again was impossible. He was broken. I be lieve his mental powers were impaired. He who had been on the topmost rung could not again begin at the lowest step of the ladder. He would not commit auicide in a direct way, so he took to drink. I have seen him wander ing up and down the streets of Melbourne, shoeless, hatlesß, begging for a threepence to get a drop of drink. I have sought him out and given him money and food. Ah 1 how well I remember his despairing wail : ' 'Tis no good, dear lad, I only want money to drink ; I only want to die ! ' and at last he died — in the Melbourne Hospital — the man who had feasted the magnates of this city, and whose name was a pow^r. He died. I was there— calling down (he curse of God upon you— and now that curse has come home."" Mr. Whinstnn's face turned an ashy gray. Hypocrite aa he waa he was superstitious ; he dreaded the dead. "" And Lucy Horton, the child of his age, the apple of his eye, the pride of his life, for whom he had plotted and dreamed and saved — what became of her?"" thundered Herbert, hie fape blazing with passion. "" Aak your son, sir, your drunken, ruffianly son, who spent some of the money you robbed from Turn Hoitoo to rum bia daughter. You knew it, too ; you did not atep in to save her. Man, Lucy was my playmate."" "" Sweetheart,"" interpolated the manager, with a demon leer. JPor a moment it seemed S3 if Harbor* would have struck the wretoh down. With|a great effoit he held himself back. ""Foul wretch,"" he cried; ""she was not my sweetheart ; I was too youag then, kut I loved her as a sister, bright, beautiful being was, and had you not ruined T©ni Hor 'ou that feeling might have deepened into !ove, and this day might have been united the two greatest properties in Australia. Ah 1 [ remember the firsf"" time I saw your son looking at her. I can recollect how beautiful she looked when at our plp.ee one evening we set up the mistletoe. Lucy Hortoa fell. What she became when deserted by your son, you know. I saw her flaunting in silks and satin 9, living her Bhort butterfly life ; I watched her going down, down, until at an age when other women be^in life, I was called to see her in the hospital 1 , whence she was never to move again. She died, too, and she died with the curae upon you that her father had pronounced. Don't think but I tried to save her. My mother, angel that she was, braved the horrors of the place she lived in, and tried to lead her back. It was in vain. Sho knew her doom, and she ac cepted it. She felt she had been blotted out of the book of life, and so she died."" (To be continued.)",Fiction

He's an outlaw, and as sich, naturally, can't count upon brotherly feeling and affection. Besides, him and me was never good friends. He was always the fine gentleman of the family, and the pet, while I was looked upon as the scrubber. Very good! 'Tan't nattrel, puttin* aside this here ques tion of outlaw, that I should be pre vented from doin' my dooty by any consideration of sentiment. But it won't do to be seen in the matter. No; I'll tell old Rossi about it. He's just the man to give me good advice.' Aimed with thi. resolution, Mr. John Davies took his departure to wards ids office. Meanwhile, the stranger, being admitted, was instantly recognised by the old lady who had opened the door. • Oh, cri P said this person ; ' may I never see light ag'm, if you ain't our boy. Oh, Lor'! Oh, crikey!' 1 Hush, mother!' cried the stranger, sternly. 'Do you want to rouse the neighbourhood? How are you? How's father ? Is George in ? Where are the girls, and ' • Oh, s'efp me, Sam, you musn't ask so many questions at once. Come in,' and she ushered him into a room fairly furnished, in which an elderly Hebrew sat smoking. Two young girls, of ages varying from sixteen to twenty, sat by the window, sewing. 4 Sam, father, Sam!' said the old woman. The old man dropped his pipe, the girls dropped their sewing, and uttered a suppressed exclamation. Davie* approached his father, and they regarded each other for several moments in silence. ' Well,' at last said the elder, ' what do you want ?' 'Nothing, father,' was the answer. 'Being in Sidney, I thought that, perhaps,"" you would be glad to see me.' 'Glad to see you,' cried the old man. ' Glad to see the son as has brought disgrace upon the family, on whose head a price is set the bushranger, the outlaw. Glad to see him, eh? Are vou glad to see him, Sarah? Arejoa glad to see him, Ruth? Are you glad to see him, mother ?' The girls did not answer, but re garded their brother with looks of distinguished aversion and honour. But the old woman, winding her lean arm around the outlaw's neck, kissed his cheek and answered : 'God knows, I'm glad to see you, Sam —my poor misguided boy ;' and then she lilted up her voice and wept, and drawing his head to her withered bosom, stroked his curly hair with those loving gestures which are instincts of women. With difficulty mastering the emotions his mother's words excited within him, the bushianger, turning to bis father, said; 1 1 could not expect a warmer wel come from you lather. And yet it strikes me I am not the only son who has disgraced you. John has not always been chief constable of Sydney.' ' John iias redeemed his character,' cried the old man. 'He is the stay and honour of the family; while you ' 4 Am its curse and bane,' was the reply. ' Well, be it so. If I prosper in my purpose, I shall soon relieve you of my presence.' ' What d'ye mean ?' 'Simply that my object in coming to Sydney is to arrange to get clear of the colony. Where can 1 find Ben Lee ?' • He'l! be here to-night,' said Sarah Davies. ' What do you want with him ? for I warn you ' She paused as she encountered the scomtul gaze of the outlaw fixed upon her face. ' Ben is courtin' Sarah,' whispered the mother. The bushranger frowned. ' I want to see him, nevertheless,' he said, 'if you will tell me where 1 can fird him. ' Nay,' said the old man ; 'if you want to see him, we'll send for him. Sit down. Mother, bring him some supper, for bad as he is, I can't forget he is our own son —our flesh and blood.' And as he spoke the old man's voice trembled, and a tear, which he understood to repress, trickled down his cheek. The bushranger turned away to hide his emotion He was of that temper which harsh words can never move, but which a gentle word can sway as easily as the wind governs the flight of a feather. His mother eagerly set about his supper, but he was in no mood to eat, and only pretended to do justice to the meal that he might please her. As for his sisters, they still held aloof. His father, however, gradually unbent, and elicited from his son the story of the sticking up of Major Glendeming. It was curious to note how the old fellow's eyes flashed as he listened to the tale. But when the Jew Boy had concluded, he said : ' And have you never reflected upon the certain end of this disgraceful life?' 'I have,' sighed the bushranger, 'and it is in the hope of escaping from it that I. am now in Sydney. If Ben Lee will aid me, I can get away.' As he spoke, the man whose name he mentioned entered the room, and instantly recognising the outlaw, greeted him heartily. At once the Jew Boy entered upon the business which had brought him to town. ' I can give you six hundred guineas for the schooner, Ben,' he urged. 'You have but to bring her off a certain point of the coast, which we will arrange, and hand her over to us. Come, what do you say.' The man addressed did not im mediately answer, but drew a short black pipe from his pocket and com menced to smoke. Presently he knocked the ashes from his pipe, and looked up. ' I'll do it, Sam. Let me sleep on it, and to-morrow I'll give you my plan. There's my hand on it.' The two men shook hands heartily, while the old Jew, delighted at his son's prospective departure from the colony, and rescue from the gallows, fell into a very pleasant humour indeed. Miss Sarah, perceiving that her lover was so friendly with her brother, unbent bom her virtuous position of cold repulsion, and her sister, following the example, a better fellowship was established. Thus encouraged by this friendly under standing, the project of the Jew Boy's escape from the colony was freely discussed. They were thus engaged when a loud tapping at the front door startled the company. The old lady, nervous and apprehensive of danger, plucked him by the sleeve, and bade him foHow her, while her husband, simulating great feebleness, slowly advanced to answer the summons at the door. Meanwhile Mrs. Davies conducted her son to an upper room, and hid him in a cabinet. As she descended the stairs, she recognised the voice of her son, the chiet constable, and entering the parlour, found that gentleman the centre of an admiring circle. 'Well, mother,' said he, 'and how are you? Had any visitors today?' ' Yes,' intertupted his father, ' but is best you don't ask any more ques tions on that score.' 'Why not ?' ' Take my word, it's best,' repeated the old man. ' You're chief constable, and have your duty to perform, and ' ' And I mean to do my dooty,' cried Mr. John Davies, with emphasis, 'even though I has to do it ag'in my vh n brother.' ' Well, well,' said the old man. appealingly, 'there's no call for that, thank Gud."" ' No, there ain't,' said his son, 'but jn the execution of my dooty I want to know who this 'ere visitor was.' 'A messenger, John, from Sam. It wasn't Sam himself. Of course not. Wouldn't I tell you if it was ? D'ye think I'd fear one brother betraying another ? That isn't nature. Ben Lee, watching the chief constable's face, noted how the fellow's eyes shifted and how a certain shame rested on his face. He drew the old woman aside, and whispered in her ear— ' Get Sam out of the house. Tell him to get away at once. I know wl eie to send my message. Tell him that hawks are abroad.' The woman instantly comprehended. Indeed she had already fathomed the treacherous purpjse of her son, the constable. She slipped from the room, and speeding to the outlaw's hiding-place, bade nim depart. ' You can pass over the back wall,' she urged, ' and slip down the lane into Kent-street; then make at once for your horse, and fly. Good-bye, my dear Sam ! God bless and protect you !' and she clung lovingly to him, as she kissed him again and again. ' Good-bye, dear mother. Ben knows where to hear of me. Good bye.' As he spoke, he slipped over the balcony of the house, and lighted upon a dividing wall. As he paused a moment ere he sprang into the lane, he caught sight of a couple of men concealed by the back door. They had evidently been placed there to guard against escape in that direction. He speedily gained the street, and hurrying to the ' D.jg and Duck,' secured his horse without exciting any attention from anyone, except. the shock-headed hostler. To this person he handed a gold piece. ' If anyone should ask you if you have seen me, say ' No.' 1 Right,' was the answer. ' I'm awake, master.' And the outlaw rode forth at an easy pace. Meanwhile Mr. John Davies, the constable, had opened up to his family his purpose. ' It's a hard thing for a man of a sensitive natur',' said he, turning to Ben Lee, ' to be compelled to suspect his own flesh and blood of harbouring them as has made themselves amenable to the majesty of the law. But as it is, I am compelled, as chief constable of this 'ere city, to put into execution this 'ere search warrant.' ' What ?' cried the father, at once indignant and terrified, for he could not guess of the manner in which his outlaw son had escaped—'what? search my house ? My own son, too ! You infernal scoundrel !' The chief constable started. Then turning upon his parent with an ex pression of anger, said: ' What ? What ? Did I hear an individool call the chief constable of the city of Sydney, colony of New South Wales, Australia, an infernal scoundrel ? My ears must have deceived me,' and Mr. John Davies snorted indignantly 'l'd slice them from your head, you ungrateful dog, if my power was as good as my will. ' Infernal scoun drel,' yes, that you are, though you are chief constable of Sydney.' 'This is high treason,'said the chief constable, turning to Ben Lee. ' It's blasphemy. I'm a King's hofficer, and any hinsult as is directed to me, reaches His Majesty through me, his representative. That's logic.' To Be Continued.",Fiction

At last, just as I was in despair, I found it; at least they said they had a piece of it, but it was in the window.” “ So you asked the price ?” “ No. I had to match it myself to be perfectly sure ; it was too important for me to trust any one else.

Sie, —The dismissal of the two min ing appeals this morning has naturally caused some excitement. My name too has, I find, been very freely handled by some in reference to the matter. Now, I have ever thought it unnecessary, if not indeed improper, to vindicate one's professional conduct in the press. There is a proper tribunal to which we are alone responsible—l mean the Judges of the Supreme Court, one of whose humblest officers I have the honor to be. I shall, therefore, take no notice of any insinuations affecting my motives or my conduct in these cases. But I do think, and I cannot resist the expression of my opinion, that it is quite time that uniformity of prac tice should be adopted in these Appeal matters. This is equally important as well for the guidance of professional men as for those miners who may de sire, or may be compelled, to act with out professional assistance. At a recent sitting of the District Court, in a case, I think, Ilydes v. Sutherland, the notice of appeal was prepared in precisely the same form as that adopted in the cases to-day dis missed for informality. In that case Mr Tyler was for the appellants, and Mr Home for the respondents, de signated by their party name, not in dividually. It may be said that per haps the objection was not taken. But every lawyer knows that the right to appeal is a statutory right and can not be conferred by consent. The learned Judge to-day saw the mons trous injustice inflicted by following the strictum jus, and was disposed to amend the notices, which in all re spects apprised the respondents of the grounds of appeal. But his Honor was met with the argument that if he did amend, the summons in the Court below would not fit the amended notice. Now in every case in the ""Warden's Court, I believe, the sum mons is filled in as it was in the cases in point. It follows, therefore, as a necessary conclusion, if the argument advanced be sound, that in no case decided could an appeal have laid. The loss of time, and the costs to all parties—the vexation to those defeated, resulting from a want of uniform system—are made palpably apparent by these cases. It can only be hoped that those who in future are involved in litigation may at least have the popularly attributed ""uncertainty of the law reduced to something like a minimum.—Yours, &c, William Pite.",LetterToEditor

Author of "" The Grandmother's Story,"" "" Mother and Daughter,"" "" Chalk,"" &n. Chapter VII. Christmas Day.. Soon after day-break on Christmas morn ing sweet strains of the .violin issued from Uncle John's room. He sat near the open window,, his chin resting lovingly upon hi« instrument, his light brown hair, touched here, and there with grey, and which he wore rather long, shining in the early sun light, 1 his blue eyes were gazing from under the shaggy brows dreamily into the garden. He played selections from "" Creation,"" and sat for an hour in the same position, when pausing he heard a voice singing in the garden : — Hark the herald angels sing, Glory to the new born King I Instrument in hand he bounded into the garden and met Laura coming towards him, her garden hat full of flowers. 1 Peace on earth and mercy mild, God and sinners reconciled. Sang on the fresh clear voice. The violin joined in and did its part right heartily. Joyful all'ye nations rise. Join the triumph of the skies ; Wilh the angelic hosr, proclaim, Christ is born in Bethlehem, j Hark! the herald aiigels. sing. Glory to the new born King, And all the little birds ija. the trees sec up a joyful twittering, and Laura's canaries, just hung under the verandah, sang fit to burst then? delighted little hearts. The anthem at an end, the two musicians wished one another "" a merry Christmas."" '"" What are we going to do till breakfast time, uncle ?"" asked Laura, ""it is not much past 6 o'clock, we have three good hours before us. Shall we go for a long walk? Shall we go to the foot of the hills 1 , Mary had a little lamb, It's neece was white as snowj And everywhere that Mary went The lamb was sure to go. answered Uncle John, laughing. So running in and bringing her uncle's hat to him, they started off at a brisk pace. Not a shrub, not a cloud escaped Uncle John's eye, and a very pleasant time they had of it. Reaching the foot of the hills they clambered up for some distance, then sat down on the tussocks to rest. < Some sheep feeding near lifted their heads and looked at them, but apparently satisfied that they were not even distantly related to the butchers, quietly went on with their breakfast. Lark after lark rose from its nest, singing into the blue sky. Be:ovr them nestled the "" City of the Plains."" Far away to the right, a dim blue line scarcely visible through the morning mists, was the ocean, to the left ranged the mountairio capped with their eternal snow's, and shining like solid silver, while like a yellow sea on every side spread the- broad plains. No* many yards distant the river Heathcote quietly wended its peaceful way.to the ocean. Clumps of green flas were growing here and the-i-e by its side, and here and there a willow, while on its surface floated a colony of docks. Gentle cows were at pasture in the paddocks near, and the blue smoke was curling from  the chimneys of the homesteads nestling among the trees. No souud of living thing the silence broke, Save that which served to soothe. "" This is delightful I "" said Laura. "" Here* far away from the bustle and din, we can •look through Nature up to Nature's God.'"" "" How frequently it is, as Cowper says,"" replied Uncle John, Full often Our wayward intellect, the more we learn Of Nature, overlooks her author more j From instrumental causes proud t o draw Conclusions, retrograde, and mad mistake. Hub if His Word once teach us, shoot a ray Through all the heart's dark chambers, and reveal Truth's undiscerned, but by that holy light Then all is plain. Philosophy, baptis'd In the pure fountain of eternal love. Has eyes indeed -, and, viewing all she sees As meant to indicate a God to man, Gives Him the praisu, and forfeits not her own. With a quiet smile Laura answered him in Mrs Heman's words : When the young eagle, with exulting eye. Has learned to dare the splendour of the sky, And leaves the Alps beneath him in his course, To bathe his crest in man's em oy real source : Will his free wing, from that majestic light, Descend to follow some wild meteor's light, Which far below, with evanescent fire, Shines to delude, and dazzles to expire ? No! Still through clou is he wings his upward way i And proudly claims his heritage- of day! And shall the spirit on whose ardent gaze The day spring from on high hath poured its blaze Turn from that pure effulgence to the beam Of earth-born light, that sheds a treacherous gleam ? "" Yet,"" replied Uncle John, ""it does hap pen that man withdraws his gaze from his guiding star to fix it upon the glow-worm, that he turns his back to the sun to look at his own shadow."" Both sat silently for a few moments, when Laura said, abruptly, "" I wonder if long life is gain or loss 1 I have wondered about it a deal of late. I notice that those who have Been most of the world seem to doubt most. It is such a pity to see generous impulses die, and faith wither up. Who was it prayed for their heart to be kept green 1 I echo that prayer. , I don't dread care, I don't fear privation, I could suffer loss, but I hope my faith in God and man will never die. I wonder if long life,"" she repeated, ""is gain or loss ? "" "" Neither all gain nor all loss, dear child. Something we had we lose, and much we had not we gain. Our own pleasure ought not to be the chief aim of our existence. Dissap pointment and trial are excellent tonics, and do a man good — give him a keen relish for all after dainties. No man is hale and healthful fed on rich food all the days Of his life. It whets his appetite, he becomes gluttonous and fastidious, his digestion be comes impaired as his epicurean tendencies develop, and he dies of dyspepsia."" "" I had rather die of starvation."" "" God forbid, Laura ! .Hunger is a dreadful thing ; it gnaws and gnaws with a slow cruel torture — No ! no ! May it never be your lot —like Longfellow's Evangeline— to feel ' the thirst and hunger of the soul we cannot still.' "" ""Wherein think you lies happiness, uncle 1 "" "" Not so much I take it, in what we have, as the being content with what we have. Depend upon it, although life may not yield us all we desire, 4t gives us all we need, or almost all."" She leaned forward, her hands clasped in her lap, her eyes looking straight before her, thinking it out, presently she said : — ""I see, contentment is the philosophers' stone, turning all to gold. Are you satisfied, uncle?"" "" Satisfied is a big word, Laura ; content ment pauses some distance off."" "" After all it seems to me it does not so much matter what life gives, as how we live through what it gives."" "" That's it, my dear ; keep the light burn ing in your own heart, and it will send a gleam into all awkward darkness."" v ""If I were to ask you, dear uncle, for a watchword after all you have seen and learned in life's school — what would it be?"" "" One that has been given before — 'patience and hope, and trust in God, my child.' "" "" I have hope— strong hope. "" "" It is the inheritance of youth ! "" ""My father has taught me trust in God."" "" Never let it go ! "" "" But patience— l have not patience."" "" Experience teacheth it."" The girl's eyes wandered wistfully over the sunlit scene before her ; she thought of what Bret Huntley had said the previous evening, that patience was often but a quiet kind of dispair. After awhile Uncle John spoke again : — ""We need resolution and sustained self control. It is easy to lose our individuality and live according to the world's opinion. Then, again, it is easy to follow the dictates of our own opinion. In one case we lose our truth and honesty, in the other we are apt to become egotistical, but bless my heart ! "" he exclaimed, suddenly jumping to his feet, "" if we don't make tracks off home we shall lose our breakfast, and that will be a terrible to do, Christmas morning too I and I'll be bound that good soul has got something that Would tempt the appetites of less hungry folk than we."" An hour later a merry party were gathered tound the breakfast-table, one of the number oeing Jack, in most extravagant spirits. Christmas boxes had been given and received —nobody had been forgotten. Mr Howard, ?fid Uncle John insisted upon wearing the flippers Laura bad worked and presented to and Jack sported a watchguard made of her hair. Mrs Viney was richer by a black ?dk dress, and a £10 note from Uncle John, yho well knew that there were two little toys in the orphanage, who called her mother, OH whom she would spend a large portion o£ *»• These little boys were to ' take tea with her to-day in the* kitchen, and two books were waiting for them on the dresser. Later on, Uncle John and Mr Howard to church, but Laura, declaring there Wa^ "" a terrible lot to do,"" remained at home, 80 aid Jack ; and Laura set him to decanter g9 wine and make himself generally useful. fa flenfc little Mrs Viney nearly into convuj. sions laughing at his jokes, and, like lone qi Ingoldsby's heroes, went about "" poking his ; nose into this and to that,"" until, receiving -k sound box on the ear from L^ura/. he , was 1 dismissed in disgrace, and tools himself .cffi into the garden, where he sprawled full length on the grass under , a willow tUI dinner was announced) and* with ,""it Brgt Huntley. .'•'"" '..■< The dinner was perfect, and everyone well pleased. Uncle John had a fund of interest ing stories to tell, but never did/ tie' Vela^e anything wonderful; but Jack had' a Ctale still more wonderful, ' which everybpdy ""but the believing gentleman knew to be the 'mbst perfect romance, and he, trusting- fellow, hands on' his knees, drank in every word' eagerly, and when anything' startling occurred in Jack's story his ""Bless my heart ! the most astounding ' I heard of in my life 1 "" sent the others into peals of laughter. At length thd dining-room was deserted, and Bret proposed a .drive ''tb Suraner. Everyone hailing the proposition' with pleasure, the two young men went awa^r for a buggy, and presently returning,, the party took their seats, Jack driving, and were soon bowling along the •'•Ferry road towards Stunner. Mrs Viney remained'. at home, happy in the prospect .'of an uninter rupted afternoon with her children.^ ' ' '- Many vehicles were on the road, arid Uncle John, who had never been that' way before, was very curious to get all the information he could. The old Ferry wharf was, pointed out to him, where the early immigrants were landed before the time of the Lyttelton rail way ; and the Bridle Path hill, which- earlier immigrants still were obliged to toil over, and then be ferried across the-Heathcote in the punt. When they crossed the Ferry bridge, and had the hills on one, side of them, and what at low tide would have been mud flats on the other, he put on his spectacle's and began to rub his hands together. Further on still, nearing the Shag' rock, and getting a good view of 'the ocean before them, and the dark overhanging rocks'on one side, he stood up in the carriage, , his hands under his coat tails, exclaiming "" Beautiful 1 "" and when at last they stood upon the' sands, the blue, white-crested waves tumbling in at their very feet, his delight knew no' bounds. "" My dear brother)"" said he, giving the blind man his arm, "" this is indeed a pleasant scene. Stretching out before us, as"" far as the eye can reach, is the mighty ocean; with the blue waves and silver spray dancing in- .the sun beams. To the right, and circling down' to the sea, are the green hills, with cottages nestling at their base, and the cottage gardens blazing with scarlet geraniums. ""On the broad, smooth beach some hundreds of people are desporting themselves ; little children dabbling about' barefooted in the water; boys sitting on the rocks fishing;' lovers strolling along side by side; old folks taking their ease in the shade, and billies, bless my heart ! billies boiling for tea' in all directions — dear me ! dear me I to see mankind at its very .best, ;see it taking, a holiday. Hark at those girls laughing! How happy everyone' seems, to be sure ! There is a little pale-faced boy up there on the top of the cave, shouting at the pitch of his voice."" So there was — none other than little Tom — a flush came into into Jack's face as he re cognised him, and Laura's brightened. The boy did not observe them, so intent was he on his own pleasure, and, as they passed on, Jack glanced at his cousin, half fearful that she might have found him 'Out, but she hadn't. They walked the whole lengthr'of the beach till they reached the hills, then Mr Howard and Uncle John sat down in the shade together, and Jack, espying a group of friends at a short distance, joined them, and was soon flirting with a young lady in pink. Bret gave his hand to Laura, and assisting her over the stones they sat down on a boulder just out of the reach of the water. Looking down at her uncle, Laura said, softly : "" Dear Uncle John ! he is one of a thou sand."" "" Hero worship,"" answered her companion. "" You will continue the perilous practice, after all the pains I have taken with you for weeks past to dissuade you from the belief that heroes still exist out of Utopia.""

By the time the long-fathoms of brown net were unwound from the great creaking reel, and coiled in the stern of the boat, the tide had turned, and a current had begun to set outward from the little ere> k in which our boat was moored. Our rusty mainsail was soon hoisted to catch the gmtD cat’s-paws from the shore, and we were under way. A word of explanation here. The shad fishing of the Bay of Fundy in carried on f »r the most part by drifting. Che boats employed are roomy, heavy, single-masted craft, with a cuddy, or forward cabin, in which two men may sleep with cornf >rt. These craft, when leaded, draw several f■•et of water, and are hard to float off when they chance to run aground They carry a deep k el, and are staunch s a-boats—as ail boats need to be. tnat navigate the rude waters of Fundy. When wo had gained a few cable lengths fro.m sh To the bre ze freshen'd slightly. It was a ran? - zephyr, but ii drove the boat too fast for us to pay on the net. We furled the sail, an 1 thrust the.boat along with our heavy sweep-, while Chris paid out the net over the stern. These Fundy boats sometimes stay out several bid. s, making a haul with • ach tide, but.it was our intention mereiy to drift, out with this ebb and return by the next fl »od. It was slow .work for awhile. We ate, told stones, speculated as to how many fish .were entangling themselves in our meshes, ami at about 9 o’clock appealed to Chris to haul iq. The trera ndous Puudy tide had drifted us in five hours ov.r 20 miles’ We decided to run the boat into the mouth of a small river on our to take a good swim before we started on our return trip. The plan was accepted -by Chris, and we set ourselves to hqu. in the net, In the centre of the boat stood two huge tubs, into which we threw the silvery shad as we took them from the mesh -s. When we found a stray skate, squid, or sculpin, we returned it to its native elementbut a small salmon we welcomed as a special prize, no I laid it away in a wrapping of sail-cloth. The catch proved to be a rather light one, though Chris averred it was as good as any he had made that year. Why* what has become of the shad 7 asked the rector,- - It seems to me that in former years-one could sometim.-s fill alt these tubs-in a single trip. Aye, aye, growled Onris, that’s true enoug.i,sir! But the ftsnin’ aip’t now what it used to be, aiid it’s all along o’ them blamed dog-fish. 1 What do'the dog-fish have to do with it? Tasked. ’ Do with it! answered Chris. Why 9 they eat ’em. They eat every tbiug they kin clap ther eye onto. They’re thiclier’n bees in thes e here waters the last year er two back. They are a kind of small shark, I believe ? put in the rector, in a tone of enquiry. Well, I reckon as how they be. An’ they’re worse ror any other kind as I’ve heern t<*ll of, because thev kinder hunt in packs like, an’ nothin’ ain’t a-goin’ to escape them, once they git into if. I’ve caught ’em nigh on to five foot long, but mostly they run from three to fo a r foot. They’re spry, I tell you, an’ with a mouth onto ’em like a fox-trap. They’re the worst varmin that swims, an’ good for nothin’ but to make ile out of their livers. I’ve seen them called ‘ the hounds of the sea,’ said B. Are they bold enough to attack a man ? They'd attack an elephant if they could git him in the water. An’ they’d oat him, too, said Chris. I hope they won’t put in an appear ance while we’re taking our swim, re marked the rector. I don’t think we had better swim far out. By this time we were near the mouth of the stream, a broad, shallow estuary 300 or 400 yards wide. In them ddle was a gravelly shoal, which was barely uncover d at low wamr, and was then marked by a line of seaweed and small stones. W(j bore up the northern channel,.and saw that the snores were stony, and likely to afford us a firm landing; but the channel was un familiar to Chris, and suddenly with a soft thud, we found nuraelv. s aground on a mud hank, 100 yards from the shore. The tide had’yet a few inches to fall, and we knew that we were fast for an hour or so. When we had got ourselves out of our clothes (he surface of the shoal in mid-channel was bare; It was about 5J yards from'the boat, and we decided to swim ever to it and look for ane mones. and starfish, 8., who was an indifferent swimmerj took an oar along with him to rest on if he should get lired. We laughed at him for tbe pre caution, as the distance was so short; but he retorted: If any of those sea-ddgs should turn up, you’ll find that said oar will come in pretty handy. The water was of a delicious tem perature, and we swam, floated, and basked in a leisurely fashion. Wo""'i we had reached the bar the tide was about to turn. The Fundy tides may be said to have practically no slack ; they have to travel so fast and so far that they waste no time in idleness. We hailed Chris, whom we had left in the boat, and told him the. tide had turn d. Chris rose frnm liis lounging attitude in Si.ern, and took a look at the water. I’he next moment he was on his f- et yelling: ‘‘All aboard I all aboard! Here’s the dog-fish ao miin’!’’ B. and I took the vrai- T at once* bu l the rector stopped us. Bick ! he c>m, inaad'd. Tney’re upon us already, and our only chance is here in the shoal water till Onris can get the boat oyer to us. Even as he spoke we noted some small black fins cuttiucr the water he- tween the boat and our shoal. - We turned bf ck with alacrity. The first thing 0 iris did. was to empty both birrels of ipy fowling piece oh >ug the fins. At once a great tur in >il ensued, caused by the struggles of two or three wound d dog-fish. The next moment their struggles were orought to an end. Their companions tope them to pieces in a twinkling. • The rector shouted to Chris to try to throw us the boat-hook. It was a long d.u’ow, but Chris's sinews rose to the emergency, and the boat-hook lan I d at our feet. The boat-hook.. was fol lowed by a brokm gaff, which struck the sand at the forth r side of .the shoal. Meanwhile, between us aa 1- the boat the water nad become alive with d >g fish. Our .shoal sloped so--abruptly ihit already they could swim up t • wiiniu two or three fet of us. ■ We k mw that the tide would soon bring them upon us, and we turned cold as we thought what our fate would, be unless Chris could reach os in lime. Then the’battle began. ... B. apd I, with our awkward weapons, managed to a un a copple of our assail ants. The r- ctor’s hoatdiook-did more deadly execution ; it‘ore of the first fish it strpck, • At ■ once the scented- their comrade’s” blood, darted on the wounded fish, devoured it, and crowded upon us for more. Uur blows with the■oar•and gaff served temporarily to disable our as- Sidapts, but not gash their tough skin. But the moment blood was started on one of our enemies his comrades finished the. work for us. Almost every stroke of the;, boat-hook tore a fishi w iicn straightway became food for his'fed'ova, fue most 1 could do ivitii my-gaff was to.tap a d )g-fish on the head’ when 1 could, and stun him for awhile; - During these exciting minutes the tid<r was rising with terrible speed - '.'The water that now came weaning 1 tfver ' bur to<.*s was.a lather of foam ami bl’dod. thcv.ugn, w hicii sharp, dark • fins, ’ ate I opg. keen uodics darted, and'crowded, and snapped. ••• ‘ Suddenly one fish, fiercer ’than the reat, made a dart at B-’s legs,” and its sharp snout just grazed his ah n, caus ing. him. j© yell with horror. We tried to getrdhf feet out : '6f' the water by standing on the highest stones we could find. Our arms were weary from wield ing the oar and gaff, but the rector’s boat-hook kept up its deadly lunges. ■ Chris had been firing among our assailants; he beb Id our strait, threw down the gun, and strained furiously upon his one oar in the endeavour to shove off the boat. She would not budge. Boys, brace up! brace up ! cried the rector. She’ll float in another minute or two. We can give these chaps all they want. As lie spoke his boat-hook ripped another fish open. He had caught the knack of so u ing his weapon that he caked his opponents from under neath, without wasting an ounce of effort. The-fight was getting too hot to last. A big fish, with a most appaling array of fargs, snatched at my foot. Just in time I thrust the broken end of the gaff through his throat, and turned him on his back. His neighbours took charge of him, and he vanished in bloody frag ments. As I watched this an idea struck me. Chris, I yell d, the shad, the shad. Throw them overboard a dozen at a time. Splendid, cried the rector, and B, pano-d approvingly, that’s the talk That’ll call ’em off. Down came his oar with fresh vigour upon the head of a dogfish, whic i turned at once on its side. Then tne shad began to go overboard. At first the throwing of the shad produced no visible eff 'Of, an 1 th“ at tack on pis / continued -with: unabated, fury. Then the water 'began to foam and twist where the shad w.-r ■ dropping, and on a sudden we were left alone. The whole pack forso >k us to attack the shad. ■ How ih w fought andlashed and sprang and tore, in one mad tur moil of fo.mi and fish. Spread them a bit, B. cried. Give the n all a chance, or they’ll come back at us. She’s afloat! she’s afloat! he yelled the next moment, in f’natic delight. Onris threw out an >ther d'Z;n of fish, Tsen he thrust his oar over the stefpbV and;.tliybig' boat moved i«lowly toward us. At in ervals Chris stopped and threw out ra »re shad. As we eagerly watched his approach the thought occurred to us that when the boat sh m IT' reach us; it .Wou}d. be, with ""the who.e pack surrounding it; ‘ The raven ous creatures seemed almost ready to leap aboard. We can use these oars and things as leaping poles, suggested B. That’s what we’ll have to do, cried tlie rector. ‘ Then he cried to Chris, bring .her sine on to the shoal, so we can all jump aboard at the sa oe time. As the boat drew nearer, Cnris paused , again; and r tfiwy' a ; shad tar astern, Away darted the dog-fish, and the boat rounded up close before us, Tiie agility with which we sprang aboard was rcm’ark-Lb>e/ had Cnris al most hugged us iu his joy. .Not another shad they’ll git out er me; he declared, triumphantly.

A gentle zephyr, Soft as a lover's sigh, ►Sweet as a baby's c-y, swept the boulevard. The sleepy hum of the lively culex mosquito soothed the senses as tho interesting little ily settled on the nose of the pedestrian, waking bim up to the delicious realities of life. The knowing little friugULa domeatica, vulgarly tn-rmed the house sparrow, sought the stray straw in the public thoroughfare wherewith to construct bis nest, for it was spring time. The trees were burst ing into leaf ; the seeds were sprouting into life ; the birds sang; the domestic rooster crowed —all was life, warmth, joy : and yet sorrow held her mystic sway in Lambton Quay. A lady, tall in statures, majostic in form, graceful in deportment, swept along the footpath with a tremulous energy, significant of electrical disturbance somewhere. Nought's more sublime than energetic bile, Like ocean warring 'gainst n rocky isis, An-1 tlie deep passions flashing through her form Made her a beautiful embodied storm.

Among the passengers going ashore there Was seen a portly, respectable-looking gentle man, evidently an Englishman, to judge from that unmistakable something which makes the English recognisable all the world over. He went with his scanty baggage (travelling Englishmen always carry scanty baggage) up to one of the hotels in Calais, and his first care, as soon as he arrived there, was to get a com fortable seat at the table d'hote, and his second to begin his dinner. He had scarcely done so when a dapper, clever, vivacious little gentleman, who cvi- 1 dently was as muih French as ho was Eng lish, took a seat next to him and began his dinner. The newcomer was a not unworthy type of the modern Frenchman. He had a spare but wiry frame, hia forehead was smooth, white, and clear, his eyes brown, lively, and piercing, his nose straight and well formed, and his mouth unimpeachable, although now and then a hard, cold expression played around his lips. His ensemble was that of a gentleman who had seen the world and profited by it. During the progress of the dinner he now and then cast a sidelong glance towards the Englishman, as if to invite him to open a con versation, which invitations the Englishman stoutly resisted, however. At last the Frenchman broke the ice. looked the Englishman full in the face, and said, with a pleasant smile : "" Monsieur, voudriez-vous avoir la complai sance de "" "" I don't speak French, sir ! "" the English man here interrupted him. ""Ah, indeed ! Fortunately I can express myself tolerably well in English, and thus I shall take the liberty to ask if you would be complaisant enough to pass that mustard ? "" "" Certainly, air."" "" HaVe you been a long time in Franca ?"" "" About one hour. I have never been out of England before this day in my life."" "" It is vnin to ask-how you find my country and compatriots ! I hope that the kindness and politeness that ono says we show to strangers may be to your liking."" "" Thank you. I have no doubt but that I shall get along very well here."" Then the conversation rippled on over the pebbles of commonplaces until the dinner was finished, when the Frenchman aaid : "" As our new acquaintance has-been so plea pant to mo, and none of my friends being present, I hope yoif will excuse tho liberty I take to present myself. My namo is Pierre Legarde."" "" Glad to make your acquaintance, sir, I'm sure. My name is Charles Robinson."" "" Eh bien, Monsieur Robinson, let me tell you that I have been many times in England, and that there exists in that country a custom which makes, indeed, to me a great deal of pleasure. You English always drink port wine after your dinners. I tried it when I was there, and found it ravishing. I intend now to try a bottle of the best that can be pro cured here in our little place, and I should be flattered if you would shave it with me."" "" Obliged to you, Mr Legarde. I shall be glad to have a chat with you over a glass of old port."" The port came, and the friends had their chat. After having enjoyed themselves a good while, discussing several varied topics, the Englishman suddenly changed the conversa tion, and said : "" Mr Legarde, I believe I mentioned to you that I have never been in France before to-day, and as 1 have no acquaintances at all in this country — unless you will kindly permit me to regard you as one — I will take the liberty to ask if you would feel disposed to do me a small favour?"" "" My dear Mr Robinson, I am entirely at your orders. What can Ido for you ? "" "" I have come over hero to engage- in busi ness, and for that purpose brought with me a considerable amount of English money, which I should like to change into French. Would you introduce me to some reliable banker with whom I could transact this affair ? "" "" I am happy to inform you that I believe I have done so already. I myself am a banker, and if you have confidence in me, the thing can bo done at your earliest convenience."" . "" That is very fortunate, indeed. If you have no objection, then, we may do it as soon as we have finished our wine and this very pleasing intercourse."" "" None at all. lam at your service as soon as it shall please you."" Dinner being finished, the two new acquaint ances went out together. They soon arrived at Mr Legarde's elegant banking establish ment, and Mr Robinson was invited to take a seat in the banker's private office. "" How large an amount would you like to have changed, Mr Robinson?"" the 'Frenchman asked. "" I have English bills amounting to some 300,000 fraacs in your currency."" "" Bien ! Would you let me look at them?"" "" Hero they are."" And the Englishman drew from his pocket book several bills, and handed them to his French friend. Mr Legarde received the bills, threw a cur sory glance at them, put them into his pocket, went to the door, locked it, pulled out a re volver, levelled it at Mr Robinson, and said : "" Now, sir, keep perfectly still, for if you stir an inch 1 fire ! You are my prisoner, Mr Robinson."" The Englishman seemed as if petrified at this sxidden turn of affairs. As soon as he had time to collect himself somewhat, he exclaimed with an expression of the deepest astonishment : "" What in the name of common sense is the matter now ? "" "" I'll tell you. Premiorment — or, in the first place — your name is not Charles Robinson at all ; it happens to be James Henry Crafton, and you are an absconding cashier from .the house of Matthews and Co., in London, with which house I have transacted a considerable amount of business in my life."" The Frenchman paused a while with an exultant expression on his face to see what effect this shot would have on his victim. As the Englishman remained immovable and without uttering a word or sound, the* Frenc hman continued : "" Two days ago I received a letter from that firm, in which I was informed that you had absconded and defrauded them of the money I now have in my pocket. They also sent me a minute description of you, and requested me, whilst they were instituting search tor you in England, to watch for your arrival here, suspecting that would take the route by Dover and Calais sooner or later. Ever since the receipt of that letter I have watched eagrerly, until I saw you an-ive to-day. I re c >gnised you almost immediately, and followed you, waiting for a good opportunity to arrest you. That good opportunity you have been obliging enough to. procure me yourself, and now I have you here ' un bout iion pistole' — or what you call at the nvmth of my pi3tol. That is what is the matter, Mr Crafton."" He kept his eye fixed upon the Englishman with a triumphant expression on his handsome face, and a cold, hard smile around his well formed mouth. Tho Englishman remained silent and immov able for a few minutes, and appeared sunk in deep meditation. Then, looking the French man steadily in the face, he addressed him in a calra, quiet tone : ""Mr Legarde, I have been considering whether it would be more to my interest to stoutly deny your accusation or confess to its truth, and have come to the conclusion to do the latter, as you seem to be too well informed of the details of this affair for me to try any denial successfully."" The Frenchman made a slight inclination, and his sneer lost a little of its acerbity, being mollified by a dash of satisfaction. "" But permit; mp,"" the Englishman con tinued, ""if I mention a few circumstances that I hope will contribute in some degree to the extenuation of my crime. I bad served the firm of Matthews and Co. long and faithfully, at a very moderate salary, which, as my family increased, became wholly insufficient to main tain it in anything like the style I could have wished. 1 was therefore obliged either to ob tain a larger salary or else to engage in business on my own account. • I had no hope of getting more pay for my sorvices, having thrown out hints time after time again to the firm in that direction without the slightest effect ; and with regard to the second alternative that seemed equally difficult to accomplish, as I had no friends or relatives in a position to furnish me the necessary advances, my own personal credit being entirely insufficient for my purpose. There was another slender chance. I might borrow money fram the firm I served. A little reflection, however, showed me the improba bility_ of success in this direction, as I had no security to offer, and as the firm probably was not inclined to furnish mo with means to with draw from their service, knowing their manner of doing business as I did, and being conse quently of great use to them. What was now to be done ? The only thing that I unfortun ately did. I appropriated these three hundred thousand francs as a forced loan. You need not smile ; I maun literally w hat I Bay. 1 bor rowed this sum without the consent of the owners, knowing that an amount so small to them would only cause them a very slight in convenience, if »»ny. My_ intention wag to go into business in France with this money, and, as truo as God lives, it waa my firm purpose to pay every penny of it back, with interest, to 1 the owners.'' "" But how ?"" "" I'll tell you. My plan was to embark in some enterprise here in France, in which I, under an assumed name, hoped by industry, frugality, and my general knowledge of busi ness, to bs able within a short time to make money enough to send my first instalment to ward paying my debt. I hoped to evade de tection until that time, and then it was my in tention to visit .my old employers, make a clean breast of the whole transaction, and throw my self upon their mercy, which I was not with out hope of ootaining, partly on account of my family and partly because this would, perhaps, after all, prove the easiest way for the firm to •recover their money. But now, since you have checked me at the very outset, allow me to ask you what you are going to do with me ?"" The expression of the Frenchman's face had gradually softened down, and he replied in a not unfriendly voice, ""Your position, Mr Crafton, is by no means so desperate as you might have reason to think; for, strange to say, the English house seoui to have taken nearly the same view of the affair as you have done. They havo no wish to injure you, but, au contrairb, they have re quested me to inform you that, in considera tion of your lonj; services to them, and for the sake of your amiable wife and interesting chil dren, thoy offer you sixty thousand franca, to be repaid or not, aecoidiug to your ability, of which you shall be sole judge, considering that sufficient to begin business with here, in Ger many, America, or wherever else you please. By using that money judiciously you will, without doubt, soon be able to send for your family, and, I hope, lead a long and prosperous life."" The Englishman gave a start ; a slight tremor shook his frame ; his lips twitched ; and he ap peared too much overcome by his emotion to utter a single word. There was silence for a few moments. The Englishman then, recovering from the shock of his astonishment, with a tear in his eye, said — ""I am unworthy of such generosity ! This noble goodness passes all bounds. Oh ! how little I knew the hearts of my magnanimous employers."" The Frenchman smiled, and continued, in muehsoftei accents — "" Well, Mr Crafton, but there are two con ditions upon which this offer depends. Your former employers desire that you will promise them to lead an honest man's life from to-day, and under no circumstances hesitate one moment to follow the dictates of your own con science."" "" That I most solemnly and faithfully pro mise,"" "" And, further, that you nevev again set foot on English soil. By exacting this promise from you they wish to prevent tho rumour of this little slip from ever reaching tho ears of your wife find children, as such a rumour might, notwithstanding the secrecy they intend to ob serve, g""et abroad in England, but it is not very likely to penetrate to the foreign country where you may choose to settle."" "" Although this condition is harder than tho first, I am fully aware of its force, and I pro mise to fulfil it righteously."" "" Very well, Mr Craftou,"" the Frenchman continued, puttiag the pist'al in his pocket, un locking the door, and suffering his face to re sume the expression of urbane politeness which it habitually wore ; "" very well, sir ! We may then look upon this affair a's nearly settled. All that now remains to do is for you to sit down at that desk and write me a receipt for 60,000 francs, if you pleaso, aud for me to pay you the money."" The Englishman wrote the receipt, and Mr Legarde paid him. ""And now,"" the latter resumed, ""permit me to ask, Mr Crafton, if yau havo formed any plans for tho future ?"" "" I am undecided as yet. I think, how ever, I should like to # go to Paris, to begin with, and there decide upon my future move ments."" "" Well, the train leaves in a short time, and if you allow me, I'll accompany you to the sta tion and see that you get off safely."" ""I am very much honoured by your kindness, and deeply thankful for it."" ! And so the two went together to the railway station. While waiting for the train they entered a cafe, took a parting glass, and had a pleasant conversation, during which Mr Craf ton promised to write to Mr Legarde as soon as he had determined upon what course to pursue, and the latter offered to do anything in his power for hia new acquaintance. | The train was soon ready to start, and with many bows, handshakings, and protestations, they parted, Mr . Crafton rolling on toward Paris and Mr Legtude returning to his counting-house, rubbing his ■hands in silent satisfaction at the clever mannev in which he had brought thiigi atbor delicate affair to a close, j The next day Mr Legarde sent the bills to London, with the following letter :—: — "" Messrs Matthews and Co., London. "" Gentlemen,— lnclosed I send you bills to I the amount of £12,500 sterling, wl'iich I have ! succeeded in regaining from your absconded ! cashier. According to youv orders I have paid him 60,000 francs, which I pray you to credit to my account in your books.— Very respect fully, ""Pierre Legarde."" By returning mail Mr Legarde received a letter from London, upon opening which he found the bill 3he had sent and this note : — "" Mons. Pierre Legarde, Calais. "" Dear Sir. — We return tho bills you sent us by last mail. Thoy are of no use to us, every one of thorn being a counterfeit. No cashier has run away from us. Our cashier, Mr James Henry Crafton, is an hon.jst old gentleman, who is sitting in our counting-rnomnow, where we write this. If you paid GO.COO francs to anybody we would ""advise you to put them to tho profit and loss account in your own books. — Very respectfully, ""Matthews and Co."" After reading this note Mr Legarderemained perfectly stunned for a while ; but gradually it dawned upon his mind that hia friend Mr Craftou, or whatever_hiti name was, had had the letters from the J-iondoi lious-o forged in order to prevent him (Mr Legravde) from scrut inising the bills too closely, Mr Orafton rightly judging that Mr Legarde would thus b8 prevented from entertaining any doubt aa to the genuineness of the bills which ho had taken so much trouble to get into his poa aession. As neither tho English nor the French lan guago contained expressions strong enough to describe Mr Legarde's rago and mortifica tion adequately, I will leave that to your imagination.— From ""A Cruise under Six Flags.""",Fiction

The glow of summer sunset in August, 1 873, glorified into beautsy the comely face and figure of a girl who leaned against a stile in one of the prettiest parts of the fen country of England. She had walked some distance from the village of Hunfinton, where her home was, and now lingered by the stile, not with the purposeless air of an ordinary loiterer, but with eyes and lips full of loving expectation. Her whole attitude told that her thoughts were far away from the lovely scene before her. And yet that scene was well worthy of more than a passing glance of admiration. The sun just rested upon the horizon, and seemed to linger there, as though unwilling to leave a world so beautiful. His level rays touched the golden heads of corn and the scarlet poppies which showed here and there a splendid blaze of colour. An occasional farmhouse and windmill or the cheerful song of a reaper lent a touch of human interest to a scene lovely enough to beguile the way farer into forgetting for a little his home ward way. Far away on the dim blue hills rested soft, fleecy golden clouds, soon to be illumined by the gorgeous hues of the dying day. A quick step behind her, and a hand laid playfully over her eyes, startled Linda Murray from her leaning posture. Turning, she found herself face to face with the object cf her thoughts, a tall youth with no special good looks to recommend him, bit with a pair of honest blue eyes and a manly bearing which had won their way to Linda Murray's heart. • Proudly and lovingly the young man gazed on the fair face upturned to his — a tender, trusting face, yet strong withal, now kindled almost to beauty by the fire of passion within. For Linda Murray's was a sensitive passionate nature, quick to feel an injury, and as quickly soothed, timid before slight dangers, but roused to heroic boldness where others are wont to quail. Linda was — -a rare thing now-a-days — beloved for her self alone, for it was Ealph Winstanley, the Squire's son, who stood beside her, whilst she was the daughter of a widowed mother, and knew what it was to bear the hardships of poverty. "" I expected you would have been tired of waiting, Linda,"" said he as he greeted her. "" Well, I suppose you found it hard to get away from this wonderful paragon of a brother, so I forgive you. Is he much changed since you saw him last ?"" 11 He is my very image now, said Ealph laughingly. "" I don't believe that even you, Linda, will know which is which when you see us together."" Linda smiled and shook her head incredulously. "" Father is coming home by the 8 o'clock train,"" continued he, "" so I must get home early. I will bring George to see you to morrow. I hope he won't try to steal the heart of my little Linnett. He used to be fond of mischief-making, but I think he has sobered down. If he does try,"" and Ealph's brows darkened omninously. ""He is such a flirt. But if I don't know which is which, what am I to do ?"" queried Linda, archly. ""He has no business to be a flirt,"" said Ealph. ""He is engaged to a doctor's daugh ter in Nottingham, where he has been for two years. She is quite a heroine, according to his account ; she helps her father, Dr Brompton, and sees him cut off limbs with the greatest nonchalance. Not a pleasant sort of woman, eh, Linda ?"" ""I don't know,"" said Linda. ""I wish I were not such a goose as to scream and run at the sight of blood What nerve she must have ?"" "" Well, let's talk of something pleasantcr than surgical operations,"" suggested Ealph. ""We shall have enough of them presently. She is coming to visit us in a few days."" Meantime they had been slowly walking towards Hunfinton, and ?oon reached the turning where Ealph and Linda must part. As Ealph clasped her to his heart she shud dered once or tvyice involuntarily, but Ealph only clasped her closer. "" You are cold, my love,"" said he. "" Eun home as fast as you can."" "" No, I am not cold,"" said Linda, as she shuddered again, and perceptibly paled. "" I don't know what's the matter with me. I hope nothing dreadful is going to happen."" "" Don't be superstitious, little woman,"" said Ralph, as he kissed her gently and re leased her. "" Good-bye till to-morrow."" As he sped away, Linda stood watching him. 'Take care of that horrid railway,"" cried she ; "" you'll be killed on it some day."" "" Never fear,"" returned Kalph, and waved his hand as he passed out of sight. For a moment Linda stood irresolute, with her eyes fixed on the western sky, where the dying embers of the sunset still lingered The red bars which streaked the sky had an almost lurid glow. By climbing a grassy knoll a short way off she might see him cross the railway. She wavered for a moment, then resolutely turned her face homeward. Just then the train's shrill whistle sounded in her ears. With Ealph's departure a shadow seemed to have fallen on the fields and the village. Above Linda's home a heavy cloud rested, which to her excited fancy was the harbinger of some dread calamity. ""How foolish I am ! "" said she too* herself, as she entered the house ; "" h'- is safely over by this lime."" Indoors the cheerful fireside glow and pleasant talk did not avail to banish Linda's boding thoughts. Strange fantastic shapes writhed and twisted among the flickering flames ; her sisters' playful talk jarred upon her excited nerves ; the most commonplace remarks seemed full of meaning. At last she made a resolute attempt to shake off her des pondency ; and although she was for the time successful, no mere effort of will could drive away from her pillow the troubled dreams which haunted her. Towards morn ing, however,"" she fell into"" a dreamless and refreshing sleep. Chapter 11. Hunfinton Hall, the home of Ealph Win stanley, lies embowered in trees at some dis tance from the village, separated from it by some fine old parks through which runs the railway to Hunfinton; for old Squire Winstan ley with more enlightenment than usually falls to the lot of country squires, had not seen fit to resist the march of civilisation, It is a strong old house, which has borne the wear and tear of centuries ; its faded splendour is beautified by the masses of clustering creepers which trail and twine arounds its weather-beaten sides. J To-night there was joy and rejoicing over one who was in a sense a returned prodigal. George Winstanley, the younger son, after long chafing at the narrowness and pettiness of his home life, had, at the age of 18, wrung from the reluctant Squire permission to go out into the world and make his fortune. He was one of the few such who do not in the long run justify the wailing and lamentation which attend their departure. Thrown upon his own resources, the lad had developed a strength of will and character which sur prised his frienda, and had already made for himself a position and a name in the medical world. The ilightiness of boyhood had dis appeared, leaving behind it a childlike readi ness to lay aside in a moment his sober pursuits, and enjoy to the full the pleasures of life. And so the gladness of his welcome was unmingled with any drop of bitterness. The old Squire's cup of joy was fall to overflowing. For the first time since George's departure Mrs Winstanley was able to come down stairs and take part in the family rejoicings. One only was wanting — Ralph, the elder son — to make the family circle complete. "" I can't imagine why he hasn't appeared,"" said George, anxiously. ""He meant to be back before you arrived."" "" I daresay that little witch has kept him,"" »aid the Squire, langhing. "" You can only expect to play second fiddle now, George."" Scarcely had the words left his lips when loud voices were heard in the hall, then the scurrying feet of servants, and presently a white, scared face appeared at the drawing room door, which stood wide open. George saw it first, and by a quick intuition divined that something had happened. Holding up a warning finger to the servant, he rose and quickly left the room, closing the door behind him. Once outside, his appearance changed. He trembled violently, and could only con trol himself by a strong effort. In a moment he was among the knot of startled servants, and gazing on the pale, lifeless face and mangled limbs of his only brother. ""Good God Il'I 1 ' he exclaimed, ""what has happened?"" "" We found him on the railway, sir,"" said one of the men, touching his cap. "" My mate and me were coming home from Wintoun farm about 9 o'clock, and we took a short cut across the railway. We saw something black-like up the line a bit, and my mate here wanted to see what it was, so we went and found poor Master Ralph. He must have been lying there since the 8 o'clock train passed."" With face ashy, pale, George bent over the marred limbs. "" Poor, poor Ralph I "" he moaned, sinking on his knees by- the body. "" Who will tell my father ? "" A startled exclamation from the group of servants roused . George from his kneeling posture, The Squire was halfway down stairs, staring with shrunken and ashy fea tures at the crowd of weeping servants. George would have put his father back tenderly, but the old man walked straight forward to the body, and a piercing cry rang through the house — "" Oh, Ralph !my son ! my son ! "" Gently but firmly George led his father away. His medical knowledge told him that death had been almost instantaneous. On looking round to find the men who had brought the body, he discovered that with true delicacy they had slipped away unob served. There was no sleep that night for the stricken household at the Hall. The Squire's last words had been, "" I will tell poor Linda in the morning."" "" It will be best so,"" thought George. And so, early in the morning, the Squire wended his way with tottering feet to the Murrays' cottage. Linda, saw him coming and opened the door, pale and trembling. ""Yes, yes, I know, it is Ralph,"" she cried in unnatural tones, ""Tell me, 0 tell me quickly."" In a few tender words the Squire told her the awful news, softening the blow as much as he could. With a wild shriek Linda fell unconscious at his feet. Curious but sympathetic faces watched the Squire as he walked along the village street on his way home. By this time all the villagers knew that Ralph Winstanley was dead — run over by a passing train — and that Linda Murray lay at the point of death. Chapter 111. Yes, Linda Murray was dying. The doctor had said that unless some means could be found to raise her from this deadly stupor, there was no hope. Gently enough had he broken the tidings to the widowed mother and sorrowing sisters. ""If she did awake from her swoon."" he added, ""he feared greatly for her reason."" In the afternoon George Winstanley called to inquire for her. At the door he encoun tered Linda's mother and the doctor. Both started when they saw his resemblance to the dead, and still more when they heard the tones of his voice. On hearing the sad news George was turning away when the doctor called him back and asked him to speak with him for a few moments. When they were alone he said abruptly, "" Are you willing to do anything to save Linda Mur ray's life ?"" George started in surprise, and then answered: ""God knows I would do'any thing in my power, but "" "" That is enough,"" interrupted the doctor. ""To-tnorrow, if there is no change, I will send for you."" In the interval George was too much occupied, to give much thought to the doc tor's strange request. Next' day the doctor sent for him, and they entered the sick room together. . "" Now speak to her clearly and distinctly,"" said the doctor.. George hesi tated, and the doctor suggested, "" Call her by her name."" George bent over the un conscious girl, and said in a clear voice, ""Linda!"" The figure stirred. ""Linda,"" again ; the eyes slowly opened, a look of consciousness began to dawn in them, then with a glad cry she flung her arms round his neck and burst into a flood of tears. ""0, Ralph, Ralph, I have had such a dreadful dream,"" she sobbed. At this moment the doctor interposed. "" You have been ill, my dear, very ill, but now you are going to be better."" "" O, doctor,"" said Linda, turning a tear stained face to him, "" I dreamt that "" ""Yes, yes, I know, my dear,"" said the doctor hastily. ""We will say no more about it. Say good-bye to Mr Winstanley for the present. You must go to sleep now."" So the doctor shortened the leave-takings. Once outside George looked at the doctor with a puzzled air. ""What is to come of this?"" he asked. "" I do not quite know,"" said the doctor ; "" but at least you have probably saved her life, whatever happens. You do not; regret that?"" 6 . "" God is my witness I do not,"" said George solemnly. When he returned to the hall he found that Rhoda Brompton had arrived sooner than was expected. The meeting was a sad one for both, for Rhoda had already been made aware of the family misfortune, and had seen the marred features of Ralph Winstanley. She, too, had been surprised at the extraor dinary likeness between the brothers, and could easily have believed, had she not been told otherwise, that it was her lover who lay dead before her. Rhoda was a tall, queenly girl of 22, with a clear, colourless face, and dark, deep-set eyes— cold, a superficial observer might have called her, for she did not wear her heart on the sleeve, or bestow her affections on every chance comer. Only a few, and among them George Winstanley, knew the depths of passion and fire in her nature. She was naturally timid, and in her manner to strangers there was something of defiance — perhaps a kind of silent protest against the hostile criticism which her pursuits had everywhere evoked. To her friends, how ever — and George Winstanley had been her friend long before he was her lover — she was passionately, nay, almost heroically de voted. To her George imparted his perplexity about Linda, and her clear intelligence understood the case at once. ""It is very strange,"" she said. ""You must be very like him."" ""It seems so, Rhoda,"" answered George. "" Poor child, what will she do when she learns the truth ?"" ""And must she learn the truth?"" asked Rhoda calmly. "" What do you mean ?"" said George in the utmost surpribe. ""She cannot go on believ ing a lie all her life. When she recovers her senses fully she will find out for herself."" Rhoda shook her head, but said no more, Several times that evening George noticed Rhoda's eyes fixed on him with a loving but regretful look, such as people wear who be hold a loved one for the last time. When they were parting for the night Rhoda clung to him for a moment with a passion and vehemence which surprised him. It was only for a moment— she recovered herself*, smiled faintly, and rushed away. Next morning George and Rhoda went together to the cottage. The doctor was already there, and in a few grave wcrds told them that Linda's state was not at all hope ful. Since George left she had talked more or less incoherently, showing now and then a gleam of intelligence, and calling almost constantly for Ralph. George went in to see her, leaving Rhoda and the doctor alone to gether. For a long time Rhoda sat gazing into vacancy, while the doctor, who had guessed at once the relationship between the pair, watched her keenly. Suddenly she turned her dark eyes full upon him, and he started almost guiltily. ""Would she recover,"" asked she, ""if George were to marry her ? "" ""Probably,"" answered the doctor. ""At east, as much as she will ""ever recover."" "" But,"" continued he after a pause, ""we cannot ask such a sacrifice from him."" ""It is not for you to ask but for us to grant,"" answered Rhoda proudly. At that moment the door opened, and George came out. He seemed strangely moved, and sinking on a chair, covered his face with his hands. Ehoda crossed the room and laid her hand gently on his shoulder. He started at the touch. "" She wants me to take her away,"" he said hoarsely, "" to take her away from here and marry her. Good God ! what am Itodo 1 "" ""You must do your duty, George,,' said Rhoda calmly. "" You cannot let the poor girl die."" ""She is a heroine,"" thought the doctor, but aloud he only said, "" I think there will be no need for such a sacrifice."" When they left the doctor stood by the window watching their retreating figures. ""Linda Murray's life is in her hands,"" he murmured, ""but she is worthy of the trust."" George and Rhoda spent the evening to gether. Gently but firmly Ehoda put aside all George's arguments, prayers, and en treaties for delay, At length, in the madness of despair, he exclaimed, "" You do not care, Ehoda. You are heartless, cold, cruel ! "" ""Do I not care?"" said Ehoda sadly. ""My love, it will be harder for me than for you."" And as George looked at her love-lit eyes and trembling lips, he could not doubt her. ""My love."" he said, ""I will do your will although it almost breaks my heart."" ""I will go away to-morrow,"" said Rhoda. ""It will make it easier for us both ; and re member, George, it must be good-bye for ever."" A few days after, in a quiet little country church in the south-west of England, George Winstanley was married to Linda Murray. ""From that* day ""Linda's recovery was assured. Every,- day brought more strength to the wasted limbs, and fresh colour to the faded cheeks. In the joy of seeing her regaining health and strength, George's past began to seem like a 'dream. Linda was a more lovable woman than Rhoda Brompton, and she soon .charmed away with her winning ways all her husband's regrets. Not until a year after the marriage was, ifc thought safe to tell her that her dream was a sad reality, and that her husband, whom she loved, was not he who had been her lover. She never knew, however, at what a cost her own happiness had been secured. Chapxbe IV. Three years after the episode told in the preceding chapters, anyone visiting the E Hospital in the East-end of London might have remarked a tall girl in black, clinging garments, draped heavily with crape, who moved quietly from suf ferer to sufferer, carrying with her joy and healing. Her face, once cold and dispassionate, and marked by deep lines which told of sorrow and suffering, for Rhoda Brompton's sacrifice had cost her her life's happiness. Not that she repented it, even in the 'darkest hours, but the heroic spirit which upheld her before her lover had failed her altogether in her lowliness. But low she thinks of it all without bitterness. It is hers to know a keener joy than any earthly love can give — the joy of self-sacrifice. Let us listen while she tells in few words her life's story to a boy of fifteen brought up in the midst of sin and crime, whose experi ence of goodness and purity has begun (but not, I hope, ended) with his knowledge of Sister Ehoda. ""Why do you wear mourning, Sister Rhoda I "" he asks, as she bathes his burning forehead. "" It is a fancy of mine,"" answers Ehoda. "" I wear it, and shall always wear it, for one I loved better than life. I lost him some years ago."" "" Did he die ? "" whispers the boy in awe struck tones. 11 No,"" says Ehoda, calmly. ""He married another woman."" ""Villain,! "" says the boy flushing scarlet, while Rhoda smiles at his youthful en thusiasm,,. No, my boy,"" she answers, ""but he set duty before love. It was my wish as much as his. I would not have ifc otherwise even if I might."" And the boy gazed with wondering eyes on Rhoda's face transfigured with the light of a high and solemn purpose, and thought that Sister Eboda must be like the angels in Paradise. That day is to him the beginning of a new and better life. He will go back to the rough men and flaunting women with whom he has passed his childhood ; but Sister Rhoda's words and deeds live and will live for ever in his heart, and will, some day, I hope, bear fruit an hundredfold.",Fiction

She stood at the bar of justice, A creature wan and wdd, In form too small for a woman, In features too old for a child; For a look so worn and pathetic Was stamped on her pale young face, It seemed long years of suffering Must have left that silent trace. "" Your name,"" said the Judge, as he eyed her With lrindly look, yet keen, ""Is "" "" Mary Magm're, if you please, sir."" '• And your age?"" ""I am turned fifteen."" "" Well, Mary,"" and then from a paper He slowly and gravely read: "" You are charged here— I am sorry to say it — With stealing three loaves of bread. "" You look not like an offender And I hope that you can show The charge to bo false. Now tell me Are you guilty of this or no ?"" A passionate burst of weeping Was at first her sole reply ; But she dried her tears in a moment, And looked in the Judge's eye. "" I will tell you how it wa?, sir; My father and mother arc dead, And my little brothers and sisters Were hungry and asked me for bread. At first I earned it for them By working hard all day, But somehow the times were hard, sir, And tho work all fell away. "" I could get no more employment; The weather was bitter cold; The young ones cried and shivered— Little Johnnie's but four years old— So what was I to do, sir ? I am guilty, but do not condemn ! I took —oh, wa3 it stealing ? The bread to give to them."" Every man in the court-room, Grey beard and thoughtless youth, Knew, as he looked upon her, That the prisoner spake the truth. Out of their pockets came kerchiefs, Out from their eyes sprung tears, And out from old faded wallets, Treasures hoarded for years. The Judge's face was a study, The strangest you ever saw, As lie cleared his throat and murmured Something about the law, For one so learned in such matters, So wise in dealing with men, He seemed on a simple question, Sorely puzzled just then, But no one blamed him or wondered, When at last these words were heard; "" The sentence of this young prisoner Is for the present deferred."" And no one blamed him or wondered, When he went to her and smiled, And tenderly led from the court-room, Himself, the ""guilty""child. —' Sunday Democrat.'",Poetry

I thought I would lapse 0 into a quiescence that would even become 0 sleep, during the interv.il of the dinner- t hour, when nothing important was likely \ to occur. But something was prepared r that would disturb me, if not exac'ly \ with the joy of elevated thought, at leist c the grateful surprise of a totally unex- c intellectual plfnsure. A younn e fellow rose and besan to speak. .My t eyes were closed, but my ears, still awake, 1 caught the sound of a fine voice producing 1 the clearest and most elegant articulat- < ions of speech that one could imagine. ; I involuntarily opened my eyes to )< ok < at the orator.

I began to observe that the sentences uttered were as good ; as the elocution was with which they were uttered. I rou«ed myself to attend, and I heard as faultless a-d altojether admirable an hour of speaking as I ever heard in my life. The youthful speaker's command of hia subject, his manife a t conversance with what it behoved him, for his present purpose, to know, was as remarkable as was his How of language, construction, and the elegant ease of his posture, his gestu r e, and his utterance. Taken as a whole, it was a brilliant phenomenon of parliamentary eloquence; and I described it as such to Mr Morley. He listened with evident sympathetic gratification, and said : ' Yes, he is a fine fellew ; a little older than you took him to be, about twenty eight. He is private secretary to Mr Balfour.

Now I: should like to know where the honest part of their proceedings comes in, as it is well-known that everything that they have done up to the present time has been done to benefit themselves indi vidually, and, I am sorry to say, to the injury of their neighbors in some cases. Now we will take one case only ; that is King street ; the Chair- ; man of the Public Works Committee takes upon himself to form a footpath.^^ in front of his wife's property, at a'-^^* cost of about £10 to the ratepayers, • and this he does without even consult ing his colleagues.

Mr Holt met her at the ' station with the carriage, and gave her a cordial welcome, just tempered by an air of humility befitting one who had sued for par don and been forgiven. In his heart Mr Holt admired Miss Yaughan more than any other woman of his acquaintance, and he would have been anxious at any time, apart from private reasons, to stand high in her \. opinion. He knew well how to make himself agreeable, and Belle and he apparently made amazing strides towards friendship during the drive home. , 'You will find an old friend at the Hall,' he said to her as they drew near. ' An old friend ?' repeated Belle. ' Yes, Dr May. He has been staying in town for some time, and as I knew you were —well, old friends — I asked him to favour us with his presence also while you were with us.' 'It was very kind of you,' said Belle, color ing asshe caught the keen, but smiling glance that accompanied hjs words. ' I shall be pleased to meet Dr May.' 'Now, what can be the meaning of all this V was her puzzled thought. 'He has got some scheme on hand, I feel sure.' Mr Holt, on the other hand, was almost equally puzzled to know why his invitation had been so readily accepted. But though mutually suspicious, they were both neverthe less bent on doing the amiable towards each other. Even Mrs Holt caught the infection, and acted her part so well that had Belle been only a shade less acute she might have been deceived. Dr May alone received her rather coolly. ' I don't believe you are pleased to see me a bit,' said Belle. ' I think you ought to have stayed at home,' said Bernard. ' Couldn't you trust me to be wide enough awake ?' * There's nothing a man does that a woman can't help him to do better,' said Belle ; ' and so here I am. If you don't want my com pany you had better go back home.' 'I wouldn't leave you alone within ten miles of our worthy host and hostess,' said Bernard grumpily, 'And I shan't go back.' ' How's the flirtation going on ?' asked Belle. ' Amazingly ; only ifs likely to come to a sudden termination. I think I shall emigrate. In fact, I've nearly made up my mind to go to New Zealand.' 'How dare you tell me such an atrocious falsehood !' cried Belle angrily. ' You think no more of going there than I do.' ' I am quite serious, Belle — really. And you needn't be angry. It doesn't concern you in the least you know. I am going to see somebody in London who has just returned from the colony and ask his opinion.' ' The most self-conceited and inflated being upon the face of the earth is a returned colo nist, particularly if he has been successful,' said Belle. ' And he considers it quite a legitimate duty to stuff his fellow- creatures with extraordinary stories of the glories of his adopted country. Why, I came across one once, and in about a quarter of an hour he made it out to be nothing less than a heaven upon earth. Only New Zealand has a serious drawback for you, Bernard.' ' What's that ? ' „„ 'It's most disgustingly healthy. This colonist I came across told me that the only persons who never got on were the doctors. He said the people were never ill, that they _jeither_Jived._ till they died of old age, or dropped down^Mfr Y2H&& -Streets, and an accident was a real godsend. The last cfoctol who settled- in the town where he lived turned market-gardener at last, and drove about with a cart of vegetables. I wouldn't like you to do that Bernard, though a background of green would harmonize beautifully with your eyes and hair. Don't go.' 'I shall think about it. I'm sorry you don't admire my hair by-the-by. I rather like it myself,' said Bernard, complacently stroking his objectionable locks. 'I might dye it, you know, but I think it >ould be an awful pity.' -' What a vain animal man is,' said Belle, * one may abuse him, taunt him, make fun of him, domineer over him as much as one pleases, but the moment any innocent ob jection is taken to his personal appearance he bristles all over like a porcupine. But seriously, Bernard, I'm sure it would be foolish of you to go.' 'Well, I have'nt quite made up my mind,' said Bernard. '1 expect it will depend how. I get on with Alice.' 'There she is yonder in the garden,' said Belle — ' I'd advise you to go and join her.' - Bernard cast a quicb-glance at her smiling unruffled face, and then marched off after Alice, looking exceedingly cross. •I believe I will go after all,' he muttered. 'I don't believe she cares a button for me. 'I'll go.and see that fellow next week.' • He sauntered on slowly, making no special effort to overtake Alice, who was strolling along a sheltered path some distance from him. The foliage of the trees soon hid him .. from Belle's view, and then he stopped alto gether. He sat down on a garden seat close by, and as he did so his eye caught the glimmer of white paper among the grass at *All rights reserved. Commenced Saturday. Decem . -beTStli. Back numbers can be had. > his feet. It looked like a letter. He picked it up. It was a letter undoubtedly ; -Written in a rather boyish hand, with an abundance of flourishes. As he turned it over, looking for the address, a few words suddenly arrested his attention, and startled him out of all listlessness in an instant, ' I want to tell you something I have dis covered about Evelyn,' read Dr May. I shall be at the Hall to-morrow,- and I .shall want you to go back with me, so get ready. You must come, or I shall be in an awful fix. I expect the governor and the old lady Won't like it, if Dr Vaughan is there, but I'll manage it some how.' Bernard had, as a rule, a profound contempt for anyone who would pry into another, person's affairs, .- and, above all, read his letters, but he had got so far before it struck him that he was doing this dishonourable thing himself. He paused as he was about to turn over, and .was. debating with himself whether it was. not. excusable under the circumstances to read a little more, when he caught sight of Alice hurriedly advancing towards him. Her excited manner and evident nervousness as she came up to him led him to the conclusion that she was the owner of the letter. Her first words proved that he was right. * . • ' Oh, Dr May, that is my letter,' she ex claimed, stretching out her hand eagerly for it. 'I dropped it, I suppose; it was so stupid of me. I — l wouldn't have lost it for anything ' She stopped in confusion, growing first red and then white, as she met Dr May's search ing, almost stern gaze. He handed it to her politely. 'I had no idea whose it was,' he said, quietly. « I was just looking for the address, so that I might find the owner.' ' And you didn't read it, Dr May — did you ? ' queried Alice, breathlessly. ' Only a few lines, Miss Holt,' he answered. ' I could hardly help it, I assure you. I read them almost at the first glance.' ' Oh, Dr May, please, please don't tell a word to anj'body,' implored Alice, almost in tears. ' Ralph — it's from Ralph, you know — would be so angry if he knew. You won't, will you, Dr May ? ' , Bernard gave the. promise rather re luctantly, for he would have preferred being left free to follow his own inclinations. He tried to detain Alice in conversation, but she was constrained and uneasy, and for once seemed anxious to get away from his com pany. The following afternoon Ralph arrived. Bernard concluded that he had written also to his parents, for they were expecting him. Mrs Holt told him so herself, while her hard face grew soft and bright as she spoke. ' I hope he will stay a few weeks this time,' she concluded with a faint sigh. 'He is so often away from home.' But when they met again at dinner it was evident that something had not pleased her. She looked cross, and Mr Holt also seemed a trifle vexed. Dr May saw Belle's keen eyes wander often from the one face to the other with observantglances. Ralph and Alice, too, looked a little uneasy, and the latter blushed when she encountered Bernard's eyes, and looked guiltily confused. 'Didn't you think the old folks looked rather put out at dinner ?' asked Belle, as soon as she got Bernard in a corner to herself. ' Well — rather. What's the matter ?' ' Nothing much ; only Ralph is off again to morrow, instead of staying with his mother like a dutiful son ; and he insists, for some reason of his own, upon taking Alice back with him.' ' Indeed !' said Dr May. 'Is that all ?' ' It isn't much, is it ? only Mrs Holt pro fesses to be much annoyed on my account, and apologised profusely. She said it must appear so strange to me that her daughter should run away just as I had come to stay with them. Then Ralph came to me after a while and told me in confidence that he wantei &U&& to help him in some love scrape, and that I wasn't to tell the ""old ghT' nor the governor on any account.' ' Oh ! he""s iv love again, is \\e ?' said Bernard. 'Looks like it, doesn't it? only he looked uncommonly sheepish over it. Of course I chaffed him a bit, and promised not to tell. I like Ralph. Rather nice boy.' ' Where is he now ?' asked Bernard, looking round the big drawing-room. ' I saw him and Alice slip out on to the terrace just now,' said Belle. ' I suppose he's telling her about his new flame.' ' Suppose you and I go too ?' suggested Bernard. Belle agreed. She seemed in a softened mood, and Bernard's journey to the antipodes was fast retiring into a very remote background. They had strolled to and fro on the terrace for some time, absorbed in con versation, when Mr Holt came out from the drawing-room and joined them. 'Do you know where Ralph is ?' he asked ; ' his mother wants to speak to him.' . 'He went into the garden with his sister some time ago,' said Dr May. ' I will go and hunt him up for you.' ' Thank you,' returned Mr Holt. ' I will try and entertain Miss Vaughan meanwhile.' Miss Yaughan seemed to have no objection to the exchange. She and Mr Holt sauntered off side by side along the terrace, while Ber nard descended the steps leading into the gardens. ' I'd give anything to hear — accidentally — what Ralph is talking about to Alice,' he mused as he went along. ' ""What can he have discovered about Evelyn ? The love business is all a myth, I believe.' He explored the gardens in vain for a long time. No sign of Alice and Ralph was anywhere tp be seen j'-but .at length as he drew near a rustic' summer house in a dis- 4 ' tant corner, he heard a murmur of voices proceeding from it. : He made no attempt to, come 1 upon the speakers unawares, but they evidently did not see him, for he heard Ealph say distinctly — '•.'-..' . ' It's no ""Use fretting, Alice. It never was ours^and rieyerwill.be.' ..■ ' ' - : ' : Alice was' evidently weeping 7 bitterly, for Dr May heard two or three deep . sobs as Ealph was speaking. A temptation assailed him to listen, but he could not quite reconcile the proceeding to his sense of honour, and he walked boldly up to the door with as much noise as possible. Ealph started up 'at the sight of him, looking rather alarmed, but Alice did not move. Dr May apologised for his intrusion, gave his -message, and with drew almost before Ealph could speak. He went back to the terrace where he found Belle and Mr Holt in deep conversation. 'I have given Ealph your message Mr Holt/ said Bernard, ' Thanks,' he answered.. He Avent indoors and left them again alone. , A few minutes later Ealph and' Alice came up, and after exchanging a few remarks also went in. ' What is the . matter with Alice V said Belle. ' She looks as if she had been crying, or else the moonlight deceived me.' 'I didn't look at her,' said. Bernard, evasively. ' And I shouldn't imagine she has. anything to cry about.' ' Unless it's your defection,' said Belle ; * I haven't seen you speak to her the whole evening. You'd better set about winning her seriously, Bernard.' ' Oh, bother Alice. What's the good, when I'm going to emigrate,' said Bernard sulkily.. ' I shall go up to town some day next week to see about it.' . . • ■ . * Belle made no reply. She was silent a few moments and then said. • I- was asking Mr Holt, when you came up, to let me see Evelyn's rooms again sometime before I went back. I thought he ""was a trifle vexed at my innocent request, but he said I might have the keys whenever, l wished. I. have often passed along the corridor where they are, but I have never heard or seen any thing of the ghost. He said the rooms were exactly as Evelyn last used them. I will ask' him for the keys to-morrow. '""What do you expect to discover?' asked Dr May. ' I don't know — nothing I f suppose,' answered Belle with a sigh. 'Discoveries seem to be at an end. We have been here a week, and nothing fresh has turned up.' Bernard recalled to mind the letter he had picked up, and did not feel quite so sure. But he kept his own counsel, and said nothing, even to Belle.",Fiction

[Thh Right op Translation is Resbevbd.] Chapter XLII. T had been about noon when John left Messrs Barrett's office. It was now between three and four in the afternoon. His long walk, his talk with Montressor, the agitation and excitement of the catastrophe, had made the time go as upon wings. But it had not gone upon wings at the office, where there was a great deal of com motion and discomfort, the pupils saying among themselves that for Sandford to go away in such a way was next to impossible ; that little Prince, the little sneak, had told some lie — just like him ; that the bosses, or the governors, or whatever other name for the heads of the office happened to be cur rent at the moment, had made a howling mistake, and that the whole affair was no thing but a proof of the general stupidity of those teachers and overseers whom it is the mission of youth to dethrone. This agitation of feeling was not confined to the pupil room or the outer office. It entered in with the most serious results, to the very sanctuary of the establishment, Mr Barrett's own room, where Mr William had a controversy with his father, which nothing but the decorum necessary between the heads of such a government could have kept in bounds. Mr Barrett was a pessimist by nature, and one who always expected to be deceived and wronged. He had heard he forgot what, that had led him to expect evil of John, and to that idea he had clung during the period of the young man's training with the purest faith. He had to confess from time to time that John had done very well so far, but — He never forgot to shake his head and add that but — Now he was, if it is permissible to say so of a good man, delighted that his prophecies were justified. He told his son that he had always expected it "" from some thing his mother told me"" — though in the course of years he had forgotten what Mrs Sandford had told him, which was not much. William Barrett, however, was of another mind. He had liked John — he had put full faith in him— he had appreciated his practi cal abilities, and the good work he did, and his power of managing men, and had been disposed to look indulgently upon any theories or plans he might have. This was all the length his mind had gone when John spoke to him first of that scheme for the draining of the Thames Valley. He had smiled at it very good-humouredly — he had said to himself that when boys do take up an idea it is generally a magnificent one, but that it is better even to plan something on a ridiculously gigantic scale than to think of nothing at all. He was prepared indeed to get some amusement out of John'i Thames Valley. Perhaps there might be something in it, some idea which a maturer brain could work out. There was no telling, but at all events it would be worth looking at for the fun of it, if nothing more. A youth of that age, with no experience to speak of, tackling a. business which had baffled the wisest ! But it was like a boy to do so. Fools rush in — or at least pupils rush in — where engineers sometimes fear to tread. So he looked forward with amused expec tation to the production of John's scheme. But when Prince told him that story of Spender and Diggs, the scheme took a different aspect in Mr William Barrett's eyes. It gained an importance, a reality which nothing else would have given it. He did not smile at the idea of this absurd youthful plan as presented to the rival office. It became immediately a serious matter ; a project of the greatest importance. All at once it became possible, very likely, that the other firm, who had nothing to do with John, might be about to reap all the benefit of him, and to enter upon the greatest efcjjineetfpg work ttoat; h^d been attempted for years, through this boy at whose plans Barrett had smiled. William Barrett had no inclination to smile now. He was deadly intent, and he could not but feel sure in the natural certainty of events that this scheme which he had pooh-poohed, would be seen in its true light by the others, and would make the fortune of Spender and Diggs. This thought had made him swear to John, though not to swear as his father, and more open to conviction. His mind was at all times more open to conviction than that of his father, and when John had burst out of the office in the first rage of his indigna tion, refusing to defend himself, Mr William, as has been said, had followed him to the door, calling him back with a compunction which he could not get rid of. This com» punction did nothing but go on increasing in the blank which followed that fiery scene. And the atmosphere in the pupil's room affected Mr William too, though he was not aware of it. He had a consciousness that the lads were saying among themselves in the slang of which all elder persons disprove, that the bosses had made a thundering mis take? Had they made a mistake 1 He was in his heart of the same opinion as the pupil room. He did not think that John Sandford had done that thing. Now that the flurry of dis covery was over, he asked himself was it likely? Had the young fellow ever done anything that looked the least like it. Had he not always been as steady as a rock, al ways honest and true, never neglecting his employers' interests, carrying out their orders, as good a worker as could be. Was it likely he should turn round all at once 1 This thought worked in his mind silently while those boys entertained each other with saying that the bosses had made a mistake, and it was greatly stimulated by the exas perating idea that Spender and Diggs would reap all the profit, and would go far ahead of Barrett's in the struggle for fortune and fame. Would they go ahead of Barrett's ? He began to remember John's start of sur prise, his question as to who it was that had carried his papers U the other office, his look of enlightenment. If they had been stolen from him, and the papers which he had flung down on the table, were, as he had said, his original scheme, Spender and Diggs might not find it so easy to shoot ahead of Barrett's. On the whole, thinking it over, it was more likely that Spender and Diggs had cheated their John, It would net be the first time. They might have put one of these men up to it to find out what the young fellow -was working at. Of course it soon got abroad among the lads what one was doing — and what more likely than that the rival firm, old hands at that sort of thing, people far more used to picking the brains of other people's pupils than of developing talent among their own. What if they had secured possession of the copy of John's scheme by one of the underhand ways with which they were familiar. On the whole that was really more likely than that Sandford, a lad against whom no body had a word to say, who had always behaved well, should have gone over, without rhyme or reason, to the enemy. By dint of long continued reasonings like this, William Barrett worked, himself up by the time he left the office to resolve upon another interview with John. He said to himself that he would put pride in his pocket and go after the young fellow, who no doubt was miserable, though he had so much pluck he would not show it. His heart smote him that he had not taken all these things into consideration before, and he had visions of young Sandford's misery and despair, which affected even the middle-aged imagination of a man quite unused to anything personal. And he felt that his father had been very unkind to John, which gave him at once an impulse and a motive for seeking him out, for though he respected his father, the junior partner was generally mere or- less in opposi tion to him. All these things together made him determined to go after .John, and have it out with him. He got his address almost stealthily, as not wishing anyone in the office to know until he saw what would come of it, and set out from the office a little earlier than usual that no time might be lost. He found the door open when he came to the house, and being himself somewhat ex cited and beyond the rule of common laws, went in without ringing the bell ; and hear ing voices in the first sitting-room he came to knock at the door. He was tKus brought into the very midst of the agitated group which we have attempted to set before the reader at the climax of their excitement. The voices ceased .after a moment, but no attention was given to Mr Barrett's knock. Something of the excitement that was in the air communicated itself to him. "" Sandfor3,"" said William Barrett, putting his head in at the door. They were all silent, staring at each other, full of confused trouble, suspicion, and uncer tainty. Even John felt vaguely when the original question rose up before him in the sudden apparition of Mr William Barrett's grave face, that another question had arisen which swallowed up the first. The intruder, who came in without invitation, feeling some how that here was a crisis above conven tional, who found that the interest centred like the high light in a picture, in the coun tenance of the man who sat at the table, leaning on it, his whole person quivering with a tremulous movement like palsy, his face turned pale, with a half -anxious, half fatuous, beseeching smile upon it, to the other man standing opposite to him, who on his side looked from John to the new comer and back again with a look of amazement and confusion. John himself stood half stupified between them giving no more than a glance of recog nition to his employer, occupied with more urgent affairs ; and yet Mr Barrett had good reason tc know that his own mission to this youth who was so strangely daring his fate, was, in one sense, life and death. "" Who do you mean by John May ? John May's not a common name, neither is Sand ford. Montressor, you're stirring up all my life, and you know it. Most things I can bear well, enough. I've gone through a great d.e&l. I'm b,ar<Jenefl to mo?t things— but not to my little boy's name. 'You've got a chUd of your own and you ou^hfc to know. I've not seen that little chap for"" 14 years. I don't know where he is now, if he's living pi if he's dead, and yet once he was the apple of my eye. Montressor, what do you- mean with your play-acting and your stage tricks, bandying about what was. the name of my little boy? John Sandford stood listening to these words which came out, with pauses between, in a voice which was heart-breaking in re strained anguish, a voice so different from that of every sophistry, the humorous self i contempt. The confused philosophy which eyed its usual utterance with sensations in [ describable, and something like a . moral overture of his whole being, vague recollec tions, suggestions from the past, horrible fears, doubts, certainties, confusion, rose up in him, enveloping him like a mist. He cared no more for William Barrett than if he had been an office boy ; he forgot all the question about the Thames Valley scheme. These things; though he had felt them half an hoar ago to be the most mo mentous in the world, departed from him as if they had never been. He stood scarcely able to speak for the haze of feverish excite ment that had got into his eyes, staring blindly, with all his faculties concentrated in that of hearing, listening for what would come next. "" Sir,"" said Montressor, "" ye, do me wrong, The drama is the drama, and I love it ; but stage business is not, as ye say, for common life. Me own name I don't deny, if all were laid bare, is perhaps not Montressor. But the poor player is likewise a\man. Had I any stage effect in me mind when I told ye there was one of your own name I. would recommend ye to — here lie stands, and a young fellow any man might be proud of. The first time I set eyes on him he saved me chyild's life — judge if I was likely to for get his name. This, me poor friend, is John May "" 41 That's nonsense, as I can testify,"" said William Barrett. "" I don't know who your friends are, Sandford, and perhaps I ought to beg your pardon for interfering, but you're very young though you're not per haps aware of it. Come, gentlemen, if you've got any hold upon this young man I shall be glad to answer your questions about him, and let him attend to his business. He is in fact my pupil, and it's not to my interest his mind should be disturbed from his work. Whatever stories you may have heard I mu9t know more about him than you do. His name is Sandford. He was placed by his mother in our hands. ""Sir,"" said Montressor with dignity, ""there are me friends, both the young man and the old. I do not turn to strangers to ask for information concerning me friends. Ye may be well-meaning but ye are ignorant —and I find ye intrusive,"" said the actor, turning away with a wave of his hand. "" Sandford 1"" cried William Barrett. Capitals could not do justice to the in» jured majesty of this cry. Intrusive I In the rooms of a pupil taken without a pre mium (this even he remembered in the shock of the indignity), this word had been applied to him. But John said nothing. He was stupified, or mad, or drunk, which was it ? He merely gave his employer a look. Every trace of colour had disappeared from his face, his eyes seemed to have a flame over them, his lips trembled. He said at last, almost audi« bly, looking straight before him at vacancy : "" My real name is John May— that was my name when I was a child — the other — is my grandfather's name."" Then the man who had injured John, ,who had taken his plans from him and robbed him, and made him appear a traitor, rose up tottering, supporting himself by the table. 11 If it's your grandfather's name,"" he said, "" and you were Johnny May when you were a child . God help us all, it's fourteen years ago. Are you my little chap, my little man that I used to take out of your bed in your nightgown, with your bonny bright eyes shining? Oh, God in heaven, I'm not fit to be any good lad's father. Are you my little boy ? Are you Johnny May ? The room and all that was in it swam in dark circles of confusing mist in John's eyes. He grasped a chair to support himself, to defend himself ; the floor seemed to give way under his feet. i* I'll — I'll come back presently,"" he said. ' Mr Barrett thought more and more, with a grieved heart, that the young fellow must have been drinking, as with a sudden rush he gained the door, and clung to that again for a moment, like a man who has no control of his limbs or movements. Then he paused, and looking at them said : "" Wait— wait here— till I come back M Mr Barrett followed him quickly, afraid of what might follow. He found John ghastly and helpless, sitting on the step of the outer door. f lhe young man gave a little nod of his head. •• Wait,"" he gasped, •• I'll be better — in a moment — I want a little air."" •' Sandford, what is the matter 1 Some thing has happened to you, what are yon going to do ?"" John did not answer for a minute. He sat with his mouth open taking long breaths, as if the air had been a cordial which he was gulping down in mouthfuls. The street was very quiet, there was nobody in sight, and the air of early summer was fresh and a little chill in afternoon greyness. Presently the young man rose and smiled faintly at his companion. "" I'm better,"" he said. "" I'm fit now for what I've got to do."" ""Tell me, Sandford, what is it you are going to do? Nothing desperate, I hope. I came to tell yon I was ready to hear any explanation "" John waved his hand with' an air of almost derision. 41 Do you suppose I'm .thinking of that 1 It's gone far beyond that."" ""What can be beyond that?"" cried the employer with exasperation, Then he seized the young man by the arm. "" What are yon going to do ?"" ""I am afraid I must have a cab,"" said John, with his confused look, ""for quick ness; besides that, I couldn't walk. Ajl my Street's, gone out of w"" » .^Bufc what are you doing? -What has happened 7 . Where are you going now ?"" John looked at his chief, the friend of so many years, with a piteous smile. ""I am going""to find out — if there's any hope for me — what's to become of me,"" he said. {To he continued.)",Fiction

Sir,— I was much pleased last night to find so many working men in the reading-room of the Mechanics' In stitute. Whilst there for about an hour, the desiro wai expressed among the working-men themselves, that an attempt should be made to form a Mutual Improvement Class. This pleaaed me exceedingly, and I ventured to suggest that the matter should be brought before the first meeting of Committee, and steps taken to encourage all so disposed to form such a class. I hare no doubt but a class, or classes, for the benefit of woiking men, imparting to them useful instruction, might easily be obtained. I felt so much pleased with the idea sug gested by themselves, that I offered to give them all the assistance in my power to promote their views. My object in writing thi», i« simply to call the atten tion of the Committee, and the working-men iu Oamaru, to this matter. If they manifest the desire for intellec tual and moral improvement, it surely is our duty to assist them. Classes for obtaining instruction in the uarful branches of knowledge,— such classes as working men could attend with freedom and with increasing pleasure, are much needed ; and I cannot conceive of anything more becoming the Institute than to set about the formation of such classes. A thousand times better that working-men visit the Institute, and endeavour to improve themselves intellectually and morally, than to spend their evenings in the public-house, where, alas ! too frequently the nobler powers of the mind are stupe fied, the conscience seared, and the affections corrupted and depraved. If you think, Mr Editor, this calculated in any way to promote the interests of the Institute, by inserting it in your valuable paper you will much oblige Yours. &c, Charles Connor.

The mother watched them till n turning in the Gap bid them from sight, and returned to her duties in the shanty. The children left the Gap, hut did not enter the plain. A great "" goanna "" lay on a rock, awaiting vagrant flies. Now, the Angela were very fond of jew-lieards and ■""goannaa"" and other harmlessnesses, and they circled the rock to see his goannaship closer. When the goanna had gone, a great striped jew lizard started up and ran before them. He beaded for the cliff, and the children thought they had him. But he advanced confidently, and, after winding round boulders and under hanging rocks and through baby passes, they found themselves in another and a new Gap, which nobody at Fowler's had ever known before. But as the Angels followed the pass, which trended shantywards although at a much greater height than the known Gap, they saw that someone else had discovered the place before them. Emerging from the pass, they found a great costeen pit, many yards square and about 20ft deep. This pit was probably the work of some prospectors of the earlier Barrier men, who might have won from it a 20,0000z slug of horn silver; and on the other hand, might not have struck anything but disappointment. At any rate, they had abandoned the hole, and the mysterious approach to the pass had hidden it from the eyes of later men. Six or seven feet below the surface of the costeen a stage of gum sapplings had been driven into the bank. Mulga and kangaroo grass and desert peas grew around and over it, almost hiding a narrow drive put in from the staging. The Angels noticed all this, and wondered. Davey Wells, who followed them ""Without their knowledge, saw these things and wondered also, for no man in Fow er's Gap knew of this once worked gorge, scarred by the costeen and the dynamite cartridge. The Angels went on, and Davey followed at a safe distance. He was very shy that day, and he did not want to see them. The Angels went on and played and went on, and the girl Angel began to sing so that the air billowed and rolled with the shrill music of a Barrier shanty ballad: — "" For nßar or far there's few Can hit like Waukaroo ; His blessed arm's a bench o' beaks— his fist's a steel bound law : An' there ain't a fault or flaw In a judgment on the jaw That's delivered at the end of all the roads to ■Waukaroo."" In this wiseßita, with Jim as a struggling chorus and Davey Wells back in the pass beyond the Costeen, humming in sympathy. The song startled two things. It startled Brady's horse, a morose animal, which liked not singing, and grazing furtively on the saltbush ; it ""startled Brady himself. If you looked around and outside the tunnel Brady had put in the cliff you would have been puzzled. Mi Brady, judging by the mullock he had thrown over the pass into the depths, had taken out about forty feet of drive; but if that were so, why had he again filled up five feet of it — why did he wall up the true face with some tagged stuff and fasten it as a conglomerate with a rammer — and why did he break into a cold sweat when he heard the Angels' voices' ? Firstly, and lastly, Mr Brady was engaged in manufacturing a mine. He had his lode all right —a great hungry ironstone — and now he had made a pocket of chlorides, so that when a pur chaser should stray along that purchaser's mouth would water, and he would cry, ""Here's another Broken Hill."" Mr Brady might have succeeded had he teen less greedy ; but Mr Brady was playing for a big stake— anything from £10,000 to £20,000— and he expected a city speculator next day. And now, after that secret stealing of picked samples, to make the bonanza ; after all the weary night cartage of the bagged stuff to the forgotten pass; after the herculean labour of tearing down piecemeal a wall of adamant 40ft long and 6ft high and 3ft wide; after the awful anxiety of covering up his tracks, the Angels came along with then* songs of the shanty to blast all his plans. In his own eyes he had covered his operations so well — he had forgotten but one thing, and that one thing all fools overlook. You can do nothing, good or evil, and escape the consequences. Justly so, the inevitable seeing eye is on you. Do a bad deed — robbery, murder, or the self-meannesses which are crimes as great — and your deed shall find a voice and tell the secret of itself to your fellow. Do a good deed, and although in an ever-decreasing ratio, according to its goodnesß, shall that deed be noised abroad also. Man says in the depths of the great desert which lies stark and wan from the Grey Eange toFarma, "" lam alone,"" and he is mistaken, because the great longing for his own kind bares his heart to the winds, and they carry his secrets, and remove his deepest memories to places where other men shall read them. Mar in the city, where man is most alone, says, "" The multitude is my safety,"" and he lies— for his neighbour reads Mm. A city is a vast deteotive office— each spying on each; in the bush man spies on himself, and is his own police man. Every policeman has a spy — Brady's spy was the Jew-lizard. He knew that the children would carry back to Fowler's Gap the tale of the new pass, the old costeen, Brady's hone, Brady's queer way of mining— putting in dirt instead of taking it out. They were perspicuous, were the Angels of the shanty, and, relentless chatterboxes who remem bered everything. He could hear them saying to Mr Ex-remittaneeman Hayes, and ex-Con stable O'Mahoney, and the crippled prospector Proudfoot— ""We did went to the soak an' we did fine anuzzer place wif a Jew-lizard an' Bwady's horse was there —he wus ; an' Bwady wus frowin' dairt into a dwive, he wus."" And then — questioning and search and detec tion. He was not an intelligent thing was Brady- He bad plenty of the low cunning which in such men passes for brains— but outside of his cunning be was dull. 80 dull, in fact, that he could not foresee the consequences of hifl criminalities— they were scarcely crimes up to that time. He argued that what be was doing with the salted drive highly respectable church-going share brokers did with scrip in the cities; and he would hare gone to gaol puzzled and indignant hadajury.con vieted him of the salting. Being dull he did not exactly see what he could do. He was determined to hold tis wild cat claim, sell it next day, and make for civilisation with the money; but he did not boo how he .could atop rt ho Angels' mouths. So without anj <fixed intention he ran out of the drive and interrupted &c twentieth repetition of the phanty .chorus by seicing t&eohildren. They were not frightened, although they dis liked him. Thef knew him and smiled — Rita •with a clear sympathetic eye; Jim with & glance arctic in its purity. They iaid, ""A-yo Bwady,"" and Brady, not Answering, took the girl by the collar and the boy by the wrkfc and, net knowing what he did, dragged them down the pass towards the costeen. They went quietly; they had nothing to fear; u>nly Brady and D»vey Wells, who hid behind a slug as be saw Brady cofflisg, were frightened. Tha mine-salter led them to the edge of the cogteen immediately above the old bush-grown staging, and before ho could think, for his mueoles were quicker than bis brain, the Angels fell with a cry. Brad/ did cot look— be ran back likd a murderer, 'because he could think now, and he knew the oosteen was bottomed with ironstone splinters sharp as flints. He ran to the salted drive, about a quarter of a mile away, finished preparing the claim for the purchaser, mounted his horse, and galloped down the pass at the immi nent risk of breaking his neck, shuddering as he passed the old costeen. He must have discovered another track to this hidden gorge, for by the way the children had reached him no horse could squeeze through. Davey Wells lay behind the rock quaking, and ■did not dare to move, for he thought Brady might return and throw him into the costeen also So the small anarchist lay behind the rock quak ing until the sun went down and the thick dusk that comes before moonrise closed over him. Then he began to cry, partly for his enemies, the Angels, and partly for himself, and partly for the darkness. And then— blessed sound — the whimper of one enemy broke the sobs of the anarchist, and the girl Angel's voice called "" A-yo, Davey."" Then the little anarchist blessed the aristocrats for ever and ever. When Brady threw the children into the costeen they fell on to the staging, the znulga branches and the clinging peas breaking their fall. There they lay unharmed but for face scratches by the branches for Angel Jim, and a little surface wound on Eita's forehead. They did not cry— they were too frightened of Brady for that, and although the staging was rickety, the Angela were perfectly safe, and swayed there, Heavenborne. "" Dad an' mum 'II come 'ere dreckly, Jim, an Marney an' 'Ayes, an' then we'll go 'ome an' have breadnjam."" So they waited patiently for the shanty dwellers, until just before the moon rose they heard Davey Wells sobbing. ""\-jo Davey."" Davey felt his way to the edge in the dark and said, ""Is ya there, Angela? "" "" Yes. Can yous get us out f "" Davey would try. Fe had seen Brady use a hide bucket in completing the salting, and he remembered that the bucket had 10ft or so of green-hide rope attached. So Davey set out on his quarter-mile walk up the pass, his heart almost still with fear of the darkness, but still stout to find that green hide bucket. His heart stayed as a stone until suddenly, from his very feet, a rock-wallaby started and hopped like a' grey ghost down the gorge. And then^Davey's heart melted, and he burst into tears. But he went on, crying like a baby and walking like a man. He found the bucket, and his courage returned — so that he whistled on the way back to the costeen. Jim, the light-weight angel, he pulled up in the bucket, and then, by scrambling, and pulling and cttching at roots, and digging her strong little heels into the wall of the costeen, and hang* ing on to the green-hide rope, Eita regained the pass. Then the anarchist, as a revenge on dirty old Brady, threw his dirty old bucket and his dirty old rope into the costeen, and the Angela applauded. Next they set off down the pass, for the moon had risen, and the night was as the day. The moon rose, and the children unconsciously blessed it for showing the road home. The moon rose, and the shanty-dwellers, their hearts leaden with dread, blessed it that it gave them light to find the Angels, for no one thought of Davey The moon rose, and Brady, watering bis horse > and filling his water-bag at the gum-fringed soak, cursed it becaused it showed him himself. Davey took the lead, as being the man of- the party, but when they reached the slug which the yellow -eyed, turret - backed "" goanna "" had basked on that afternoon, he drew back to let the Angels out first, and so guard their retreat. Eita, feeling the loss of her protector in the van, sang a line of the song of Waukaroo to keep up her spirits, and stopped again, for she was overstrung by the crime of Brady, Now, Brady had finished watering his horse and filling his bag at the soak, and had just mounted when he heard the song-line. Mr Brady shook a great deal, but rode on. And as he entered the Gap he saw the Angels, with blood on their faces, step out of a solid wall into the light, for Davie was yet in the shadow of the rocks, and Brady knew not of this foot passage to the unknown pass. When Brady saw these, then, he almost fell out of the saddle with fear. He recovered him self, dug the spurs cruelly into his horse, and fled like the wind through Fowler's Gap, his horse's hoofs striking the iron road like hammers on anvils. They at the shanty heard this furious galloping, and Hayes connected it somehow with the disappearance of the Angels. Tho Barrier is almost entirely enclosed in wire fences, as the country was originally sheep stations. The shanty is built just inside the gate of a Sturt's Meadows paddock— when the gate is closed you catch the horseman, because he dare not ride over a wire a night without strapping a coat to it. ""Hayes shut the gate, and then, like a lightning flash on the moon's rays, they saw Brady, hatless, ghost-faced, gallop up, falter an instant at the closed gate, and rush at the top wires. The horse hits the wire, but recovers. The scoundrel is a great rider, which covers a multitude of sins. It is a great leap— he is over and far out on the Broken Hill road, leaving behind him a shoe cast in striking the wire, which vibrates like a dis connected piano string. And after Brady, in hot pursuit, ride the ghosts of the Angels, bom of his crime and his superstition. The shanty-keeper and the prospectors had seen Brady's face as he rode away from horror, and they went towards the soak to see what had frightened him. And they found that the Angels had driven the Brady devil into an insanity of fear by merely being alive and singing a shanty song. So the three children were taken to the shanty kitchen and cried over, and Davey Wells was the man of the house, and Davey Well's father came ithere quite sober and kissed Davie, a thing he had been too drunk to do for mnny months. And the love and the innocence and the sweet cunning of tho children — who were all three An eels now — fell on the lonely men and the one woman of Fowler's Gap like gracious liniment on a wound. And God was on everybody's lips and in everybody's heart that night, and the moonlight said to them, ""Don't sleep but onjoy these Angels who will one day be passion-stained and weaned men and women like yourselves,"" and there was music everywhere, the m-yht tbe anarchist — anarchist now no longer — brought the atigelsback from the costeen. And"" the grown . folks heard tho story of Brady's mine in the hidden pass, and ex-remit tanceman Hayes seemed to derive much comfort from saying, over and over again, ""I always disliked Brady — Brady's eye 3 tad a common focus."" Nobody know what he meant, but they all agreed with him, because they had an idea that having eyes with a common focus was a disgrace ful thing, and they felt like that towards Brady. O'Mahoney also related that Brady waa very like a man he knew who was an Orangeman, which was quite enough for O'Mahoney. I might tell you here that next day the Angels guided Prouifoot and Hayes and Wells and O'Mahoney to Brady's "" salt."" Well, they took out all the bagged chlorides, which had come f*om a hundred miles away, and they struck a few feat into tha real face, and came on a glory of gleaming whiteness and emerald, and that glory was a bonanza cf 16,000 ounces with silver at 4s tho ounce. Hayes said, •"" You ccc ! A man whose ejes hare a common focus loses more than he make?."" Tfao thiof threw away the hoaeet sove taiga to grasp the crooked sixponcd Again. The Hidden Pass turned out for Proudfoot and Hayes and Wells and O'Mahoney another Apollyon— they took out of it a fortune a man. So that Davey and Eita and Jim will be a gentle man and a lady and a gentleman one day if their parents have their way, which I pray they may not. For ladies and gentleman are as common in the world as sand at Bancannia, hut the angels of the world are very very few. Well, on that moonlit night while the children slept, dreamless as the stars, and Hayes and O'Mahoney cursed Brady root and branch, Brady himself rode south-west in a cold sweat, flying the Barrier for eyer, and suffering the ineffable agony of crying over spilt milk. /",Fiction

Sir,— A short time ago there appeared a paragraph in the Evening Star commen ting on the management of the Wellington Hospital; but looking at the management of our own Hospital I think thnro hj need for retrenchment. I notice that the average number of patients in the Dunedin Hospital at present, according to the weekly returns, if, about ninety, and the attendants vary from thirty to thirty-six. When the new Hospital 'Hoard signalised their advent to power they appointed a secretary at a salary of L2OO per annum, yet the secretary to the old Committee retains his position at L' 225 per annum. Now, the question arises: Why have two secretaries? In former years, when there were fewer up-country hospitals, the average number of_ patients in the Dunedin Hospital was 1""5. Times were better and our taxation less. The house steward was then paid L 175 per annum, and the annual expenditure was something under L 4,000 ; now it is close on LB.OOO. These facts manifestly indicate extravagance and mismanagement somewhere. Surely the resident surgeon and the new secretary are sufficient to superintend the internal management of the institution. When the Government pro vided the ratepayers with a Hospital and Charitable Aid Bill, they did not expect the ratepayers to maintain an expensive estab lishment. The new Board should carefully look into the management of the Hospital and see if retrenchment is not practicable.— I am, etc., A Ratepayer. Dunedin, January 30. [Our correspondent is rather mixed. The secretaryship of the Hospital Board is quite an independent odice, and the holder has nothing to do with Hospital management.— El». E.S.I",LetterToEditor

Grenville Murray, in "" Bide Lights on English Society,"" tells the following story about a lady in Brighton:— The reason why people fought shy of the graceful feline, Mrs Fox, was that, although she was not more than twenty-eight years, she had had three husbands, all of whom had died with mysterious suddeness. The three deaths had brought her three fortunes, and the young widow was mightly rich in consequence; but at Brighton, where she mostly resided, people whispered of poison, and nicknamed her "" Lucrctia Borgia."" Toxicolo logists hold it as an axion, demon strated by universal experience, that when a person has once administered poison with impunity, the temptation to do so again and again becomes irresistible. A little knowledge con cerning the action of drugs, a little prudence in apportioning the dose, a little judgment in selecting the time, a patiently affectionate behavior towards the victim, and the risks incurred are almost nil. The poisoners who come to trouble are the novices in the art, or those who, grown reckless by repeated successes, neglect tke pre caution which carried them safely through previous experiments. Of course, if a wife ilavors her husband's soup with a whole half pound of rats bane, bought at the nearest chemist's, she must expect that the coroner will inquire into the matter. So must the wife who prefaces her drugging with a series of violent domestic scenes, wherein she calls her neighbors to witness that she is married to a brute, and wishes herself well rid of him. JJut tkci'O aro. no coroners' juries abroad, whereas numerous popular re sorts for invalids exist, where a man's rapid death would excite no manner of surprise. How suspect the loving and tearful young wife who brings her already ailing husband to drink the waters of Phosphore-le-Bains, and seems so miserably affected by his con dition. The pair have brought ser vants with them, and put up at the best hotel, whore they pay generously. One of the local doctors is called in and feed on a scale quite magnificent, according to his French notions. He prescribes the waters of the place; the patient takes them, and in one day he dies. But what of that % Phosphore le-Bains is accustomed to see its broken-down visitors die off like, flies ; when the doctor has received a vale dictory 1,000 franc note in acknow ledgment of his precious services, he would be an unmanly churl if he de manded a pod mortem, or refused to sign a certificate stating that the patient had succumbed to natural causes. Indeed, if this doctor com mitted the mistake of hinting at foul play, without positive proof, it might cost him his practice. Certainly the hotel-keepers who recommended him would never forgive his having drawn a scandal upon their house, and even the local authorities would frown upon him for trying to scare away visitors from their town. As the French custom is to bury within forty-eight hours after death, the deceased stranger is soon laid in the local graveyard, and there is an end of him. His sorrowing widow lingers a fortnight in the place, to pay for a handsome tomb stone ; she discharges her hotel bill, thanks the attendants of the deceased for their sympathy, and then vanishes, leaving no address, but only the repu tation of an excellent, open-handed person. This is what the gossipers of the Brighton Club used to say to one another as they watched the pretty but suspicious Mrs Fox driving up and down the King's road in her smart pony-chase, drawn by a pair of frisky greys. Sim held the reins herself; a boy-groom sat behind, and by her side figured a toothless servile old dame, who was her inseparable companion. Together the pair used to show them selves on the West Pier, at the Aquarium, at the Pavilion on Satur days, when the Garrison Band played ; they had sittings at the Ritualist Church ; and lived in a showy bouse on the Marine Parade, where no ladies were ever seen to call. This isolation was, however, due rather to the. cir cumstance that Mrs Fox took no steps to cultivate acquaintances among her own sex; for, had she done so, not a doubt but her drawing-room would have been as well frequented as that of any other wealthy young widow, ladies would hardly have been deterred from calling on Mrs Fox by a rumor which rested upon not so much as a tittle of authenticated fact. Probably her nick name owed its origin to the joke of some disappointed suitor ; but, like many other jokes circulated in fun or vindictive malice, it "" took "" famously, and during a whole Brighton season was so pitilessly thrust at all suspected anglers after the young widow's fortune that Mrs Fox remained, to all matri monial intents, as completely shunned as if she had been a leper. Mrs Fox had never belonged to the innermost circle of good society ; but she was of excellent middle-class rank, well edu cated, and a capital pianist. Her complexion was pa'e, her hair dark; her eyes were keen, and could shoot killing glances. There was in her compact little ligure a lithencss which suggested the activity of a cat; while the mobile expression of her eyebrows and her quick nervous way of laughing were evidences of a temper which would be sure to make her obtain the mastery in any household where the titular head was not a man of excep tionally iron make. Mrs Fox occa sionally alluded, and in feeling terms, to her last husband, but never to the first two. On the whole, she was a person of remarkable attractiveness, and never failed to impress male listeners with the idea that she would make a first-class wife, and be an ornament to an affectionate husband's home. A good-looking and much indebted officer of the Hussar regiment in gar rison determined to brave the preju dice that was assailing this widow with such a cowardly stupidity, as he called it, and proceeded to pay his court to the lady, but he instantly became the butt of ferocious pleasantries. Some of his brother officers who could draw ipapered the mess-room with sketches descriptive of "" Captain Doughty finding a queer taste in the sherry "" ; ""Captain Doughty writhing on the hearthrug, with a hand on the pit of his waistcoat and his eyeballs starting from their sockets""; ""Captain Doughty having a conjugal tift'with Mrs Doughty, and being cautioned by her in the well known words hurled by Lucrczia Borgia at the Duke of Ferrara: ' Guarda a vol, il mio quarto marito!'"" (Mind what you are about, my fourth hus band.) If Captain Doughty had lived in a duelling country he might have stopped this persecution by challenges ; but a British officer has no remedy against chaft' but grin ning and bearing it, or else remov ing the cause which gave it rise. This is what Captain Doughty did. He ceased to court the seductive widow, and bore with what face he could the crowning piece of i'acetiousness of his friends, which consisted in wringing his hands with silent force, and ex claiming "" Thank Heaven, old fellow!"" just as if he had been rescued from inevitable and violent death. Mrs Fox's next woer was a young solicitor, who would have been very glad of her money to set up business with ; but one clay he received, by post, a copy of Alexandre Dumas's ""Marquise de Brinvilliers,"" with a photograph of his inamorata pasted on the lly-leaf; and when, having made inquiries, he learned what rumors had dictated this delightful warning, he fled in horror, never to return. A merchant and a naval captain were successively scared off by similar pranks, and all this while Mrs Fox, being ignorant of the things bruited against her, could not, for the life of her, understand what made all her lovers act with such inconceivable flippancy and lack of manners. The present writer became ac quainted with Mrs Fox about a fort night before the catastrophe which opened her eyes. It was a cruel joke that was played upon her, and proved once again what little consideration women have to expect from the other sex when they are not protected by the strong arm of a male champion, or, failing that, by a blameless reputation. A masked ball, in aid of some charitable object, was given at the Pavilion, and Mrs Fox, who did not generally attend halls, went there under cover of a domino and of a laced mask, which effectually concealed her features. Her companion attended her, and the pair did not mix in the dances, but move J about, watching the fancy dresses and enjoying the music. They had been thus harm lessly disporting themselves during an hour, when one of those ruffians who are to be found in high ranks as well as low strode through the hall in the guise of a police man, and with his physiognomy tra vestied but not masked. He was evidently in search of Mrs Fox, and must have detected her by the un gainly figure of her companion; for, upon esp) ing the two women in the Chinese room, he marched straight up to them, and, laying a hand roughly on Mrs Fox's shoulder, thrust a paper before her eyes. What was written on this paper was never ascertained, but the unfortunate widow uttered a piercing shriek and swooned on the floor. The pseudo-policeman beat a hasty retreat, and his victim had to be carried into a retiring-room, whence, after a second fainting fit, which left her as weak as water, she was sent home in her carriage. She never showed herself in public again; but within a week sold her furniture and ponies, and for ever quitted Brighton, leaving no clue to her next destination. The brutal joker did not reveal his identity; but the details of his freak transpired, and were variously com mented on, most men being of opinion that there must have been a grain of truth in the accusations, which else, said they, would never have struck such deep roots. Possibly, however, Mrs Fox was simply a widow whoso misfortune, rather than whose fault, it had been to lose three husbands in countries where there were no coroners and no inquisitive penny papers to harry her with impertinent questions.",Fiction

Such is the case with me, for in rol ling about from one country to another, 1 certainly have gathered no nv.s-, but am quite .is b.ire as when I a'.arted to roll. Jiut one thing 1 have gathered, and that is, that farmers in all countries where I have been are very disunited ; those in the Auckland Province are especially so, and more par ticularly those of the Waikato. Another thing I have gathered is, that all other classes unite together for thoir mutual benefit. Only see what wa have in Auck land. There are corn rings, land rings, rings, and Heaven only knows how many other rings. Attain, we have Associa tions ad libitum, there are tho Grocers, the Butchers,' the Bakers,' and as the auctioneers .say, others too numerous to mention. The hrmers through their disunion become the ""Beasts"" for all those ""Birds of Prey,"" and they do put their hooked beaks into them most ruthlessly, so much so that they get all the flesh off their bones, leaving the poor farmer a perfect skeleton as tar as cash is concerned. Just take tho Grocers Association for example; they not only want you to take out all the butter in groceries, etc., but, they must have two pence per lb for selling when butter is be low Is and threepence or fuurpence when it is above Is. I call this doing it with a vengeance, and yet this is only one of the ""Birds of Prey"" that are constantly peg ging away at the poor "" beasts."" A year or so since when a certain Hamiltoman gentle mm was going to ""shake Heaven and Earth,"" I mean those "" l'.irds of Prey,"" (the middlemen) from their perch by co-opera tion, I thought there was a promise of success, but aa soon as I saw their method of procedure I at ones perceived that it was going to he the shadow only. You know, Mr Editor, as well aa I do, that if an association or company is to be successful in its operations it must be conducted by practical, straight forward, honest, business-like men, and not by mere theorists, and they must start without taking off a lot of old seeds and rotten Swiss cheese. When our cheese and bacon factories started I thought they would be a benefit to all of us in general, but the farmers in this, too, are like a lot of hounds after a hare; the leader gives tongne, and all the rest follow, without questioning whether they are on the right trail or not. But instead of all going in for one thing, some should have gone in for cheese, others for butter and others for condensing milk, and then, instead of our factories going ""the way of all flesh, they might now be still in the hands of farmers themselves, instead of having to let them to those who will run them in their own interest. As it is patent to all that our factories have proved a failure, let us try to find the cause thereof, and the first that presents itself is inexperience, or bad management. The second, dishonesty of suppliers, for I have been informed on good authority tint some avaricious farmers not only watered their milk, but set the evening's milk in shallow vessels, and skimmed it next morniiiK before sending it to the factory. And, thirdly, the method of purchasing milk adopted by the factories, for had milk been paid for according to the cream that it contained the dishonest man would have reaped the reward of his dishonesty, but as it is now he has not only brought on himself the desserts of dishonesty, but has dragged the honest man with him, and instead of getting 2Jd per gallon for their milk, and have the skim milk for pig and calf-feed, as they ought, and would, if by proper management and honesty they'had kept their factories in their own hands, they are now only getting 2; ! f d for 10ilb3 of 10 per cent milk, thus adding to the already numerous multitude another ""Bird of Prey.""—Yours truly, Rolling Stone.

' I've just read in the local paper which is published near my old heme,' said Crabtree, 'of the death of Dave Timms. He should have died sooner. Poor Mrs. Timms—l wonder if she will marry again.' 1 Was he a cruel husband ?' asked Mrs. Crabtree, in a sympathetic tone. ' Very. He treated his wife shamefully for years, and then crowned it with an act of infamy for which he deserved the severest punishment.' ' What did he do ?' 'He deceived her basely. He used to stay out o'nights to scandalous hours and then brazenly lie to her as to when he got in. She finally found that he had placed some simple but ingenuious mechanism in the clock by the aid of which he could make the helpless timepiece strike any hour he chose, and that the fellow was actually planning to patent it and place it on the market under the name of ""Timms' Married Man's Friend but she sold the clock to a pedlar and got a new one with which he could not tamper. After this she invariably arose and met him and pointed out the error of his way gently, but firmly. ' On these occasions he w uld stand with his shoes in his hand and lie unblushingly about why he was so late. Usually it was work at the office. At other times it would be a sick friend. In point of fact he had in every instance been with light-minded companions playing poker and other sinful games. ' One night he came home ex ceptionally late. The uncorrupted and uncorruptible clock smote the hour of four as he enteied. She arose and started down. She had been awake some little time, and had several things in her mind to say. That is, several new things, besides all the old ones. She was, in fact, pretty mad—righteous indignation, of course. She knew how he had been engaged and determined that the wretch should remember the occasion for the rest of his days. She could hear him foraging in the pantry. As she reached the foot of the stairs she saw a little packet lying on the floor. She picked it up. It was labelled ' candy.' She tore off the wrapper as she walked along the hall and placed the find in her mouth. As she paused at the pantry door she saw her husband making an assault on a piece of sponge cake so big that he had to hold it in both hands, like a loving-cup. She brought her teeth together firmly. I blush for my sex when I say they did not open. She struggled, but the words which she would have uttered —the earnest, needed words—died away in her throat. She tried again, but her jaws remained fixed, im movable. 1 My dear,' said the monster before her, swallowing a great lump of sponge-cake in his throat, 'my dear, I admit that it is late. Far be it from me to contend that four a.m. is early in the evening. But I have been sitting up with a sick friend. A dear old schoolmate. A friend of less happy days, before I was fortunately married. Alas! poor fellow, he is very ill. I fear he must go from us. Do you not sympathise with your husband in the loss of his friend, my dear? Why so reticent, love?' But the poor woman's thoughts on the passing away of friends was but a minute fraction of what was that night unuttered by her. Three more efforts she made to rend her jaws asunder, but each time she failed. Then she fled upstairs. Jt required the aid of the family physician in the morning to give her relief. The alleged candy was, of course, some sort of an unholy compound of concentrated adhesives prepared by the creature to whom she was linked for life. I hope he reformed before he died, but il scarcely seems probable.'",Fiction

After his marriage it wa3 his custom once a week to have a musical entertainment at his house, when instrumental and vocal selections were given, and Christmas was always kept up with great gaiety. Luther himself was an excellent singer, and he composed music for several of his hymns. The Ecost celebrated of his com positions is the Battle Hymn or metrical version of Luther's Psalm, beginning with the line : Em feste Burg ist unser Gott. No translator has ever been able to reproduce in English the spirit and sublimity of the original. Thomas Carlisle, fifty-two years ago, published a translation opening with the lines : A safe stroDßhold our God is still, A truaty shield anct weapon. The following translation, by Rev Joel Swartz, D.D., is generally regarded as the best that has been made : A mighty stronghold is our God, A sure defence and weapon ; He helpa us free from evo y need Which hath us now o'erfcaken.

Coixis, The San Feancisco Mail Service. — Mr. H. Webb, the contractor for the Sau Fraucisoo mail service, passed here in the s.s. ' Taranaki on his way to Wellington. As Mr. Yogel was not able to leave Wellington fora fortnight or three weeks, Mr. Webb has proceeded thither for tho pnrpoae of conferring with him upon the modification of the contract, as authorised by the Assembly. Mr. Yogel will (says the Independent) shortly proceed to Melbourne, to seek the cooperation of the Australian Colonies, and may probably succeed so far as New South Wales is concerned. We ob serve that in the Parliament of New South Wales an animated debate took place reoeutly on the San Francisco service. The Premier of that Colony moved the House into committee to con sider the propriety of adopting the contract en tered into by the Melbourne conference. In the debate that followed several members opposed the resolution, on tho ground that New South Wales had got the worst of it at the recent con ference. The most important party to the treaty, England, was altogether ignored. It was also urged that a scheme formerly proposed was preferable, by whioh three lines vid Suez, Torres Straits, aud San Francisco would bo carried out for £100,000. This plan, it was said, would satisfy the Queensland people, and save the San Francisco steamer going out of its way to land the mails at Moreton Bay. After some consider able discussion, the motion was lesc by 24 to 15. It will bo thns eeeu that so far as New South Wales is concerned, the Australian Colonies are not likely to come to any agreement on the postal question. ' Agricultural Labourers' Conference. — A meeting of agricultural labourers was held lately in a barn in asmall village in Herefordshire (Ashforteu), for the purpose of comparing notes a« to their condition. After a rather lengthy speech by the chairman, a schoolmaster, the labourers had their say. A man named Pugh said he received 9s. a week, and "" the run of a pig,"" with his cottage ; bnt the pig he seemed to consider rather a disadvantage than otherwise, for he stated that "" a pig won't get his own livin,' especially suoh a summer as last summer ;"" and then he proceeded to show what became of his wages. He said first of all he paid 6s for bread ; then there was a shilling for the pig, ""you cant keep a pig uuder ashillin' •"" and there was another shilling for shoes, which was eight shillings. Then there was sixpence for the children's schooling, and meat and sugar had to come out ot the remainiug sixpence. He sug gested that if they all put their shoulders to the wheel they would be able to obtain 23 6d a day. Another laboarer, John Pearce, said he had six children, his wife, and himself to keep out of 9s. a week ; his shoemaker's bill last year was £3 4s. lid.; and he asked how was he to pay that ?",LetterToEditor

Sir, — You deserve the thanks of the ratepayers for tho manner you have ex posed the affairs of the Borouah. Tho ratepayers whom I have beard speak on the matter have not ridiculed the Herald; far f rom it; they have all spoken in praise of the fearless manner you have written and upheld the position you have assumed. But as a ratepayer who is disgusted with the burden he with tho rest has to bear, and with the small return that can be seen for the money, I protest against the present system of conducting Borough affairs. Surely, sir, no sane man believes that day work is cheaper than contract work. That there are times when it may be preferable, I will admit, but they are rare, very rare indeed. Contracts give every man a chance, the weak as well as the strong. It is cheaper because men as a rule work harder and longer hours when contracting than they do by the day, and also workmen prefer it, as they are not bound to time, being their own masters; for this reason they will work for less. Men have a strong objection to the cutting down of day wages; bnt whilst refusing a reduced rate by the day, will contract at a price at which they cannot make more per day than the amount refused ; and beyond these facts, for they are facts, is it fair that a favored few should have all the work of the Borough ? That con tracting is more expensive than day work in supervising is not a fact. All the supervision required in a contract is to see that it is carried out according to plans and specifications ; and these should cp. tainly be made and drawn np by one trained to the work. The penny wise and pound foolish economy is very applicable to the present sjstem of day work, as car ried out by the Borough. The Borough have standard levels of its streets ; but are these kept to in new formations? By having a competent person to lay off and supervise contracts, the whole of the work would be according to those standards, and every penny spent would be on per manent work, not as has been the case too frequently — considerable sums spent to rectify past errors. The remuneration given by the different Road Boards, and by the Clifton County Council, amounts to abont 7£ per cent, on the contract price. This surely is no great sum to pay for the services of a competent engineering surveyor. The Works Com mittee may be practical business men at their own business, but that is not laying off streets. There need be no expense incurred either for ad vertising, for a notice in the Borough glass case would do away with this. Workmen soon find when a contract is coming out, although, of course, the greater publicity of a newspaper is better. I have heard that the question of the cost of carting has been challenged, and it has been asserted that a good cart and driver cannot be got under 15s per day by con tract. This is ridiculous, for I know that at a contract let recently two good carts and two good horses, and also ore good man, were supplied at 10s per day. I do hope, sir, now that there is so much distress among the workmen of the town, that our councillors will see fit to let as many contracts as they can. — I am, &c, Contbact.

Next morning Ralph and Alice set off for Glenburn, notwithstanding their mother's I evident annoyance. Alice was to return in two or three days, but Ralph would not pro raise to accompany her, and Mrs Holt was | not pleased. ' I can't think what has come over Ralph,' she said to her husband. ' Glenburn seems to have a fascination for him.' 'Some female fascination, probably,' said Mr Holt, carelessly. 'I hope not,' said Mrs Holt. 'Neither Ralph nor Alice seems likely to fulfil our ex pectations yet, James.' ' I have a foreboding that none of our expectations will ever be realised,' said Mr Holt. He stopped and listened a moment, for Belle's voice was audible outside the door, asking the servant where his master was. ' She wants those keys probably,' said Mr Holt. ' You'd better go and make everything square, Agnes.' Mrs Holt; retired, admitting Belle as she went out; Mr Holt had guessed correctly — she had come to ask for the keys of Evelyn's rooms. ' I will send for them,' he said, ringing the bell. A servant, soon appeared, and was despatched with a rnejsga.g'& <ia Mrs. l\xJib. -■--""' ' _'3yiU_' I jii>u~sit down a few minutes mean while, Miss Vaughan ?' said Mr. Holt ' I have some news to tell you.' ' News ! ' echoed Miss Vaughan, seating herself. ' Yes — at least I think you cannot have heard it yet. Mrs Roland Fairfax is dead.' ' Dead ! ' cried Belle ; ' dead ! Why, what, ailed her ? When did she die ?' ' Nothing ailed her, that I know of,' answered Mr Holt, gravely. •It was the result of an accident. She went out driving, as she usually did every fine afternoon, but this time the ponies took fright at something, bolted and upset the carriage over a steep bank. Harriet was thrown out violently, and her head struck against a large stone. She was picked up unconscious, lingered a few hours, and then died.' ' Did she never recover consciousness again ?' asked Belle, looking, as she was, greatly shocked. ' I don't know,' answered Mr Holt. ' I only know what I have told you. A friend of mine up in the North told me these few particulars in a letter I received this morning.' 'It is very shocking,' said Belle. ' Poor girl, I admired her very much.. I thought she had the loveliest face I ever saw. 7 'A face marred often by ill temper,' said Mr Holt ; ' otherwise lovely enough.' ' Oh, Mr Holt, if only poor Evelyn were living !' said Belle, involuntarily. ' Yes— if only she were,' said Mr Holt, gloomily eyeing the pen he was holding in his fingers. 'It would wind up beautifully by and bye, I suppose.' ; ; There was,. v a_ ; few,.; momente ,sii§nce| vrhil^ ■ : Belle- scanned Mr Holt's face narrowly, anfl^ wondered if he knew how her mission Mid : Koland had ended. She determined at last, with her usual audacity, to ask him"". | 'Mr Holt,' she began, and then paused a moment. ♦ Did you 5l eve""r know or hear, that I accomplished the purpose of my journey to lloland .Fairfax?' :. h - . ' I did,' answered Mr Holt, calmly; He did not seem in the 4east surprised at the question, but he never raised his 'eyes from the table upon which he was leaning. ' You did a cruel thing,' said Belle, indig nantly, f ' I did not think so at the time,' he answered. • You forget, Miss Vaughan, that hard-headed, practical elderly people like me , are not likely to consider the romantic side of a thing. But I was sorry — really sorry after wards.' Perhaps he was speaking the truth. Belle almost thought so as she watched him, and noted^ the unwonted gravity of his face, the drooping attitude and downcast look— -all so unlike his usual bearing. ' This man is a puzzle,' she said to herself. * He is naturally amiable, naturally generous — I almost believe, naturally kind-hearted, also ; yet evil has gained the mastery over him for the ticce^ He-has fits of repentance ; sometimes conscience makes him uncomfort .able ; but he hardens again, and is worse than before. As for his wife, she has all his bad qualities without his redeeming ones. -In short, she is a fiend in — ' ; Her reflections were cut short here by the entrance of the ' fiend ' in question. 'lam sorry to keep you waiting so long, Miss Vaughan,'' she said courteously ; 'but I had mislaid the keys somewhere.' She handed them to Belle as she spoke, as if she intended allowing her to visit the rooms ( alone. But that was far from being her inT~"" tension. Belle had not been there five minutes before her hostess joined her. ' May I come in ?' she asked pleasantly. 'Do you know, I have only been in these rooms once since we came to live at the Hall. How lonely they seem, don't they ?' Lonely they seemed truly, and silent almost as the grave, as Belle and Mrs Holt stood to gether, glancing round. Yet, though they were supposed to have been shut up for long months — though no one excepting Mr and Mrs. Holt had ever been known to set foot within them since Evelyn's death — Belle noticed with surprise aud curiosity not a speck of dust was to be seen anywhere. The mirrors- were as bright and undimmed as though they had been recently polished ; the open piano, the knicknacks strewn about the tables,' the pictures on the walls — everything, iv short, within the rooms showed no trace of dustancl neglect. Belle made no comment, but she wondered greatly. ' We have kept everything just as Evelyn, last used it,' said Mrs Holt presently, in a subdued tone. • There is the piano as she left, it ; her work-table yonder, with her favourite easy- chair drawn up to it ; and on that little stand close by is a book she was reading, open, face downwards just as she left it.' Still Belle made no comment, but she shot quick contemptuous glances occasionally at the speaker as she walked slowly about the rooms,, gazing with reverent affection and tenderness at the objects that reminded her so forcibly and sadly of her lost friend. She looked searchingly around, hoping to find some trace of the ghost or of some more tangible occu pant, but she saw nothing until they turned' to leave the rooms. Then she suddenly spied a little white object tucked between the foot of the bed and the mattress, as if it had been, thrust there in haste. She drew it quickly out. • Is this a handkerchief of Evelyn's,' she asked spreading it before her. It was a handkerchief, white and dainty, but not Evelyn's, for in one corner, as she held it up, appeared the name ' Barbara Brown ' written very distinctly in marking ink. Mrs Holt caught sight of it too, for she stretched out her hand impetuously as if to seize it, luitT apparently"" she change~3~""hef "" mind. Belle turned and looked at her. Her hand had dropped to her side, and her face was deadly pale. ' Who is Barbara Brown,' asked Belle, with her sharp bright eyes fixed on Mrs Holt's face. ' Barbara Brown,' stammered Mrs Holt. ' Really — I don't know. She must be a friend of one of the servants, ,1 should think I remember I sent a girl in some time ago to — to dust and put things tidy.' Belle made no answer. She watched Mrs Holt fixedly as she spoke, for her curiosity was excited by her nervous and agitated manner. She retained the handkerchief however, though Mrs Holt again made a slight movement as if to take it, Belle pre tended not to see it, and began talking about . something else. Mrs Holt looked uneasy but made an effort to talk carelessly as if she too had forgotten it. . . ' I should like to spend a whole day in these rooms,' said Belle, when they stood in the corridor again, and Mrs Holt was locking the door. ' A whole day !' echoed Mrs Holt. 'Yes, a whole day. I feel somehow as if Evelyn were nearer to me there,' said Belle. ' What a curious fancy,' remarked Mrs Holt stiffly. •'. ""*r Belle smiled quietly, and turned away to her own room, where she sat down to examine her trophy again, Und to meditate over it. , . 'Barbara Brown,' she repeated as she gazed at the name. 'I wonder why this handkerchief has a sort of fascination for me I wonder too if she is any relation of Dr -crown. I have half a mind to write to him now and aslr if he ever attended Evelyn. I have a suspicion that Mr Holt palmed off somebody else for him.' She did not meditate long before . she de cided to write at once. She did so, and in due time received an answer. The Dr Brown whose address Bernard had ob tained from Mr Holt had gone to reside in Germany, where he still was. In reply to Belle's letter he wrote that he had never attended any person of the name of Evelyn Holt, and had never even heard it before. He added that there were so many physicians of his name in London and elsewhere that pro bably she had made a mistake in the Christian 4pame. The next time Belle met Mr Holt she asked him abruptly where the Dr Brown had gone who had attended Evelyn. 'To Australia, he answered, looking at her with unruffled composure. * When Bernard enquired for him at the address you gave, he was told he had gone to Germany,' said Belle. ' Ah, that was the wrong man,' said Mr Holt. ' That one did go to G-ermauy, 1 ' You gave Dr May his address,' cried Bell. ' You said that he had a practice there . — you told Evelyn so.' • Once had, I said,' replied Mr Holt. ' Evelyn must have misunderstood me. This Dr Brown was an old acquaintance of mine and in his youth he practised at the place I described to Evelyn. He was staying — at least I thought he was — at an hotel there when Dr May asked for his address.' 'He had gone when Bernard went to see him a fortnight later — gone to Germany nearly a month before,' said Belle. 'It was a mistaEe in the name,' remarked Mr Hplt. * The one I meant went to Aus traM.about the same time, and died there about five months ago.' ' Oh, dead is he ? ' said Belle, in a tone of disappointment. ' Yes. If you had asked me before, I could have given you his address. It is too late now.' ' Bernard did not want it urgently,' said Belle. 'It was not of much importance whether he got it or not. , ' Just in the interest of the profession, I presume,' remarked Mr Holt, carelessly. 'Wanted to consult with him— eh, Miss Vaughan ? ' ' Just so,' answered Belle as carelessly. 'Is this man telling the truth or. not? 1 she mused. ' I feel sure he did tell Evelyn that Dr Brown had a practice at this same place, but I can never know now. I believe he got somebody to personate this Dr Brown, to whom I wrote — probably someone not a doctor at all. 1 She dropped the subject then, and pro ceeded to ""make herself unusually affable to Mr Holt. It was wonderful how friendly the two had grown of late — outwardly at least. They might often be seen together, absorbed in conversation;, and in outdoor expeditions Belle invariably found herself Mr Holt's companion. But the friendship was not very sincere on either side, and neither succeeded in deceiving the other in the least. (To be continued.)",Fiction

Major Richardson was scarcely landed, when he appeared in a supple ment to the Witness — not only in self-defence, but for the purpose of making a further effort to lessen the character of the Superintendent, and to terrify the electors from all idea of retaining a man in their service whom he had pronounced guilty. I thought the voluminous report and printed evidence on the public accounts had brought the Superintendent low enough, but evidently Major .Richardson is not yet satisfied : he has conceived a lower depth of degradation ' still, and indirectly asks the Superintendent to .consummate the act with his own hand, by mak ■ing a formal demand on the Treasurer for the production of a private letter in that gentleman's hands. Mr. M'Glashan, in his defence, produced all the letters he considered necessary for the- in ' formation of the Council, and if he considered the production of a certain letter an improper act, or at best inexpedient, then he was quite justified in withholding it, and the public can have no fault to find. Of all men, surely the Treasurer was the most competent judge of what documents would best answer his defence : he was in no way trammelled at the time by the Superinten dent, and as far as the public know, he is un trammelled still. If so, the more active mem bers of the Finance Committee of Inquiry should refrain from probing a matter which the Trea surer seems to think too delicate for public ears, not to speak of how harrowing it would be to the feelings of one who has just returned from the discomforts and buffetings of a long sea voyage. Let well alone : all must confess that Major Richardson "" has done his duty."" Duty I duty ! duty !— That will be the rally ingcry at the next election — Duty ! That is .one of the finest words in the English language, because it is the name of that golden principle which has been the guide of the Christian in past ages, and of Garibaldi and Major Richard son in our own day. In the present state of Otago men are very apt to imbibe depraved notions of what is their duty. If the electors are to take their cue from the address of Major JRiehardson, they would condemn the Superintendent at once, without reference to what the Auditor-General may report. On the other hand, I would advise the electors to suspend their judgment till the accused has had an oppor tunity of speaking for himself. When a criminal •is brought before a Court of Justice, he is never asked to implicate himself; on the contrary, the witnesses' are examined in his presence, and the whole of the evidence against him is submitted to his inspection at every point, and when the case for the prosecution is completed, the prisoner is asked what he has got to say for himself. If he has"" nothing to say, the Judge may appoint some one to plead on behalf of the prisoner all that can have a tendency to mitigate the severity of the sentence. Even when a murderer is to be condemned, the Judge giv^s him the benefit of every doubt, and the full value of any extenuating circumstance that may lessen the guilt of the un happy man. Now has the Council in its judicial capacity, treated the highest Executive officer in the Province with the same consideration — justice and respect — as the Supreme Court would treat its vilest criminal ? Ist. Did the Committee of Inquiry examine all witnesses in presence of the accused ? ' ' 2nd. Did the Committee submit to the inspec tion of his Honor all the evidence that had been collected against him ? 3rd. Did^eCkjuncil, on receiving the Report on the Pnblic Accounts, and after hearing the de fence of the Provincial Treasurer, allow the Su perintendent to utter a single word in his own defence ? "" If so, the Council has acted an honourable part and is fairly entitled to the thanks of the com . munity ; if otherwise, then the decision may be a rash one. If the Superintendent wished to con front his chief accuser, and the request was re jected, then no sentence should have been pro nounced by our Councillors ; they should have remitted the evidence without note or comment to his Excellency the Governor. In the Report of the Committee of Enquiry there are serious charges against the Superin tendent, which I cannot defend 5 but there are other charges which hardly came within the province of a select committee. When the' public appoint a Treasurer to keep their money in a strong iron chest, he is supposed to watch over it as- if it contained the life's blood of the Province ; it is at his peYil to touch it. They, however, the possibility of. him lending a needj' jpr'ieud, or of tampering with ihe money himself : ""for this-purpose they demand two sureties, worth more substance than can be embezzled in three months, The Auditors are appointed for the purpose of taking a peep into the chest every t . quarter, to ccc if "" all is right. "" The public, as far as I can judge, have far less cause for alarm than the sureties : and if the electors choose to 4hink that the horror thrown around the whole aflkir is more imaginary than real, and re-elect the Superintendent, what will hje said ? Enemies will say— The people of Otago are lost to all sense of duty ; lake Representative Institutions ' from them, and hand them back to the Crown. Others will say — The remembrance and gratitude of the past exceed their prudence. Friends will say— We can find no one with brains enough to fill his place. Neutrals will say — It is the most flattering reception which has yet been given to any settlerof New Zealand. The bare possibility of such an event is even now gall and wormwood to the Speaker of the Council, for it would be substantial proof that Mr. Macandrew still slum bers in the affections of the people ; and perhaps the only reason that could explain such an event would be the fact that the electors know that he sacrificed himself for the advancement of the colony, and has injured himself far more than he has injured the Province.

Them was to be a wedding among the fhu«.-'. The bride wag a dreary little thing, and every body wondered why the bridegroom wanted to marry her. Her name was Can't, aud - cV> e belonged to the family of Donothingt. tii\* had tears in her eyes half the time, and hor mouth was drown do wn at the corners, as though she were always just at the point of crying. She never, stood up alone, gracefully as a maiden should do, \fo she fairy or human ; but leaned helplessly on whatever happened to be near. As Bhe did not always look to see what her eupport was, she sometimes received a sharp «ting from a wasp, or was whisked over by a grasshopper. Nona of thess lessons taught her better — which was a great pity. The bridegroom wasa stern tellow, much older than the bride. He looked cross most of the time, and it must be confessed was not charm ing. His name was Won't ; he belonged to the family of Obstinateß. His eyes had a kind of determination in them that was not very pleasant to see. He never leaned on anything, as poor Can't did ; but he did not take pains %o help anybody else. The fairy queen and all her court felt very anxious about the marriage. Indeed there was a time when the queen thought that per haps Bhe ought to forbid it. She was very desirous that her subjects should bo happy, and had made it a principle never to interfere be tween lovers ; but in this case she hesitated a long time, because it seemed so very unfortu nate for two people of bad dispositions to marry. On the whole she decided to let the wedding take place. May was chosen for the bridal month, be cause it was named for a family connection of bride and groom. The name was written down on the ancestral tree Of each. Poor Can't, who uever liked anything, cried A little, and said to her lover : "" Indeed, I can't be ready so soon ; besides there will be no fireflies to make it bright."" '* Drat the fireflies,"" said the hurly Won't. {We cannot blame Can't for being offended at such language.) "" Drat the fireflies !"" he repeated. "" There will be the loveliest stars of the year, and moonbeams clear onough to dance on. Fireflies, indeed !!>! !> "" But,"" persisted the bride, "" the stars are so far off, and moonlight is pale and cold. I always wanted fireflies at my wedding. I can't bear to give them .up."" Then she fell to weeping. Won'c tried to comfort her ; though he would not consent to put off the wedding. The night came, and a most lovely one it was. Even the blades of grass had put on overskirts of gauze made of tli9 finest kind ot dewdrops. The fairy king, queen, and court were dreßsed in their gayest dresses. An orchestra was placed a little in the distance. Tiie frogs played the baas viols and violon cellos, while hundreds of insects took the lighter parts. It was rather solemn and sad music ; but that suitpd the taste of the bridal pair, and was quite in keeping with tho oc- Cision. Some of the fairies wanted a dance ; but the bride and groom had no spirit to lead off, so it was given up. The refreshments were very delicate. Tt was too early for some of the nicest dishes ; but; they had delicious jelly, made of the dew of the strawbery blossom, and very nice ices of apple and pea.-h blossoms. The wines were of violet and swtetbiiar, very sparkling and nice. It was quite a relief to the company when the time came for the bridal party to start on their trip. A large dragon-fly had been en giged to carry them. He had been waiting on a clover-leaf for somo time, waving his large winars. and wishing the bride would hurry. At last she came ; and the groom put her on the pillion behiud him, then mounted himself. He' chirruped to the dragonfly, wa<""""l his hand to the company, and they were off. Muutidy is wanted on the wedding- trip ; so we will not go with them. The queen, who was very gracious and affectionate, resolved to i^vo a grand merry making, to welcome home the pair. While they were gone, she and her maidens exerted their ingenuity to devise all sorts of delights that would be so charming it would be impos sible for anyone to refuse to be pleased. You sac they were obliged to take very special care on i"" Tint of the unhappy dispositions of Can't and Won't. When the evening came for the fete, all were gathered around the queen's throne, waiting in expectati in. "" Oh, dear,"" whispered Lady-bug to Violet, "" don't yo i wish they mere a little more cheer ful person*?"" "" Well, yes, I do,"" replied Violet. ""It is forlorn to be so- but hush, there they are ! ' Sure enoigh it wa< Can't and Won't, re turned on the back of the faithful dragon-fly. They sprang off, and seemed really gl-id to be at home again. They kissed the mnd of the queen, and answered her inquiries in a ve>y cheerful manner, assuring her that uhsy had passed a mo3fc delightful honeymoon. After this they turned to greet their various friends, and even smiled in response to their kind welcomes. • c Why, what has happened?"" whispered the fairies among themselves. Nobody could tell what had occurred to change the behaviour of their old friends ; but it was evident that marriage had improved them astonishingly. There was no objection mado to a dance on this evening, which wa** a- meiry as you please to fancy. Afterwards supper was announced. The bnde's health was drunk in nectar, and the bridegroom returned thanks for her. Then he said : "" Dear Queen and all our friends, .1 wish to make a confession. My sweet wife has ask' d me to do so for her, as well as for rcyeelf. When we started on our wedding tr'p we were very uncomfortable, and each fee red we could never learn to agr j e. I was very hard, cold, and thoroughly disagreeable ; and my dear wife was — well — just a little weakminded and desponding. Ido not like to say this, and beg you to forget it. We were troubled when we thought of our future. One day I said : ""'"" ' Dear wife, suppose we change our names?' "" * Change our names !' she answered. 'We can't ; but if we could what good would it do?' "" ' Well, dear,' I said, ' perhaps then we might be better.' *' ' What name could we take ?' said she. "" 'We ought to have the same, now we are married,' I replied ; 'and, as we both need a change of nature, why not become Mr and Mrs Try ?' 41 Til try,' said she ""Til try,' said I. /'So this was a sort cf silver wedding to us. Since then everything has gone on beautifully. I never say ' Won't ' in my former bad fashion, and my dear wife never says ' Can't ' in hers. ] Together we have resolved to be gentle, to do j^he very best we can, and be happy. It is astonishing to find how easy it is to give tup "" ""And how easy to bo strong-minded,"" inter rupted the bride, ""and to find you can do things if you try."" Here the bridegroom kissed the bride, and sent such a succession of blushes over her face that the corners of her mouth fixed themselves m a smile, and the bright light that settled ""Jen in her eyes stayed there for ever after. Ihen all the fairies were glad. They formed a ring and sang with joy. This was the song, as well as I could hear it : Oh, how happy we shall bo In our work, in our play ; No more froffcin? wo shall s'eo All the livelong day.

Chaptke XIX. The Letters of the Dead. k LF AN HOUR later, when Dr Arthur arrived at W'eirmere Hall, he found Lady Blunt' walking up and down the drawing-room in a state of restle3s impatience. ""I thought you were never coming, doctor,"" she said, giving him her thin, twitching hand. "" I came as soon as I received your note,"" he answered. "" I told you what I wanted,"" continued Lady Blunt, in her nervous sharp way; ""I want you to prop me up for a journey, lam going to town to-day."" ""It is impossible, Lady Blunt ; you cannot go — y O u are not fit to go,"" replied the doctor with great gravity. "" I may not be fit to go,"" said Lady Blunt, gloomily, "" I know very well I am not fit to go, for that matter ; but I must go. I have come upon certain letters, doctor ; letters so important that I must learn by personal in spection whether the strange news in them be true. If it be true——"" And Lady Blunt made a sudden pause. Dr Arthur was silent for a minute, then he said, "" From what you say I conclude there is a certain amount of anxiety aud excitement con nected with these letters, Lady Blunt? 1 "" The greatest anxiety and excitement,"" she answered, quickly. "" Don't say what you are going to say, doctor,"" she added, raising- her hand emphatically. "" I know very well the danger of sudden excitement to me, This journey, and the knowledge this journey may bring me, will perhaps be my death, but if it were twenty times my death I must go through it J I must know the truth ; these letters— the letters ot the dead — have told me astrargetale, and an imperative duty, a duty alike to the living and the dead, commands me to learn the truth."" ""Well,"" said Dr Arthur, musingly, ""you must take care."" "" I wish to do that. I will not excite myself if I can help it, and I want you to Rive me something to strengthen me, to keep me up, in' fact, and nerve me to do what is plainly right. And now tell me how is Mr Fletcher."" ""He is going on fairly well ; if all goes right there is no fear of him now."" ""He is a good man, I think."" said Lady Blunt, look ng at Dr Humphrey inquiringly. "" He is a good man, I am sure,"" answered Dr Arthur, •'straight and true. I don't cay he hasn't faults, but Robert Fletcher's faults are not those that raise contempt."" ""And his Bister?"" asked Lady Blunt, still looking at Dr Arthur, whose dark penetrating eyes now fell before hers. "" She is a handsome young woman."" he said, briefly, and with a certain reserve in his tone, that Lady Blunt noted. • ""Yes; and I believe good?"" said Lady Blunt. ""Most certainly good,"" answered the doc tor, rising and approaching Lady Blunt. "" But now, Lady Blunt, let me feel your pulse."" After this their conversation naturally turned on Lady Blunts health. She was in no condition to undertake this sudden journey, the doctor told her, and Lady Blunts own sense told her the same. But for all that she must go. She repeated this to Dr Arthur, and he pmiled and shrugged his shoulders aud said he would do his best for her, won Bering all the while what made her so determined to do what she knew to be so unwise, but concluding, not unnaturally, that it was somehow connected with the unwelcome marriage pf her son. ""You will take Appleby with you?"" he aaid. presently. ""I have thought of it, but I have not decided,"" answered Lady Blunt. ""Jenkins, of course, I will take."" ""I advise you to take Appleby,"" said Dr Arthur ; and then after some further conversa tion he took his leave, but not before he had a warning word to whisper in the butler's ear. ""Lady Blunt insists upon going to town to day,"" he said, as Appleby was helping him on with his overcoat. "" She is not fit to go ; you must do your best not to allow her to excite herself."" Appleby bowed, but looked and felt anxious. "" Her ladyship seems determined to go, sir,"" he said, and Dr Aithur nodded and then went away, and active preparations were at once commenced for Lady Blunts journey after he was gone. Lady Blunt herself made some silent private preparations of which her servants did not know. She unlocked and took from her despatch-box a packet of letters which she had but placed there the night before. This packet of letters, or rather two packets of letters, which she had tied together were all addressed to her late husband, Sir Henry Bluet, to his club in London generally, the addresses faded, the ink grown pale with time. They were all in one handwriting — a delicata feminine hand — and they all had one signature; a signature which made Lady Blunt start and grow pale when she had first read it, and then smile disdainfully ; yet for reason of this sig nature she had read through these letters of the dead, and for reason of this signature also she had decided on the sudden journey to town. She had found these letters by a mere acci dent. When her husband died John Chester had gone up to London, and had brought down Sir Henry's body to be laid in the family vault at Weirinere, and he also brought down Sir Henry's letters and effects. A3 was but natural the widow, who had long ceased to love her husband, did not care to go over his letters. They were put into a great trunk and locked away, Lady Blunt retaining in her possession the unused key. And thus they had lain undisturbed year after year, and probably would have lain so still but for Mr Chester's death. But during the transfer of the management of the estates to Robert Fletcher, a certain lease of an extensive farm was not to be found, and Lady Blunt and Robert Fletcher searched for it in vain. At last it suddenly struck Lady Blunt, on the very evening before we find her preparing for her hasty journey, that this lease might somehow have got into the trunk wtach Bhe knew contained her late husband's letters and private papers. She was anxious to find this lease as it was nearly run out, and the tenant had, through Robert Fletcher, applied for a renewal, but at a reduced rental, and under certain circumstances Robert Fletcher had before his illness advised Lady Blunt to renew. Sitting in her solitary state the night before Lady Blunt had suddenly thought or' the long unopened trunks which stood in a room now seldom used at the Hall, but which had for merly been Sir Henry's smoking-room. Lighting a small lamp she now went to this room alone. No grief stirred in her chilled heart as she looked around and recognised many little articles which had once belonged to her dead husband. No, her love was dead also ; had died a long lingering death caused by the man's own careless, faithless life. But though she was done with all regret for him, a certain awe always creeps over us when we touch the belongings of those who have lifted the veil of death, and who know so much that we still cannot understand. This awe was on Lady Blunt as she turned the key of the trunk which contained her dead husband's letters. It was on her as she lifted out packet after packet, time- stained and faded, and as her eyes fell on two words written in her late husband's handwriting across the up permost letter of two distinct packets of letters, all in one soft, feminine hand. The two words written by Sir Henry were Mary's letters. The wife stood with these letters in her hands knowing well, after she had read Sir Henry's simple inscription, who had written them, and that these letters were from the fair Mary Fletcher, the mother of Sir Henry's children. She stood there— Lady Blunt— and looked at them, the bitter days, perhaps, re curring to her when she had first heard this woman's hated name. She stood there — half curious. She knew her husband had loved Mary Fletcher and never loved her ; Sir Henry with brutal openness had as good as told her this many a time. But she felt curious to know how much this woman had loved him. Yes, she would read one of her letters. It could do no harm now, both were dead, and her love (the wife's) dead also. It was but curiosity, and so Lady Blunt opened one of Mary's letters, and read thewoids traced in the faded ink. What were those words? Tender affec tionate words enough about ""our darling's"" schcol bill ; about the rent of a house, regrets for his money troubles ; yes, a kind, tender letter enough, but it was the signature that made Lady Blunt start and grow pale. She dropped the letter she had read, &he took up another of the same packet — the same sig nature to each—"" your affectionate wife, Mary Blunt!"" | ""She must have been mad or a fool,"" cried Lady Blunt, half aloud ; yet she deliberately now sat down to read the dead woman's letters through, and as she read on she grew paler, and trembled. There were many like the first she had opened, ordinary letters from a wife to an absent husband, letters about money, about servants, about the hundred tntics of which our daily life is composed, but there were other than these. There were letters full of passionate reproach. ""You will not surely wrong our boy,"" said one of these last, ""you will acknowledge us before he is old enough to understand the shame which is slowly destroying his mother's lite ? Harry "" continued this letter, "" when you and I s-tood yon morning before God's altar, if I could have believed you would have acted as you have done, I would have rather died before I left my father's roof. I loved you dearly then, I love you dearly now, and yet my life has been one long suffering. You promised faithfully to acknowledge our marriage ; promised to acknowledge it to my dear father, and now he has gone to his grave believing his daughter to be no better than a castaway ! I had a letter from his lawyer this morning— Harry, what do you think ? He, the dear old man, has left our boy the dear old home at Weirmere. He has left it to his daughter's son. Oh !my dear, my love, give the boy his rightful name ; give it to him before I die."" There were several letters in this strain, and as Lady Blunt held them in hertrembling hands she noticed that these passionate en treating words were dated but a few months prior tp her own marriage. The last letter she read contained but some brief, feebly traced lines. In this Mary thanked him for promising one day to acknowledge their son, "" though it may be after | am dead,"" the poor woman had written. Then apparently tho poor woman had died. There were no letters doted after this ; none after two months bnforn Dorothy Sykes had married Sir Harry Blunt, and brought her great fortune in her loving hands to relieve him from his embarrassments and his cares. And now Dorothy Sykes— Dorothy Lady Blunt— sat still and read her dead rival's letters. She read them with alarm and fear. Good God ! what a story was this ! Perhaps, and Lady Blunts lips grew white and trembled, perhaps she had never been his wife ; she might still be Dorothy Sykes, and her boy a boy of shame, as she believed Robert Fletcher to have been ! "" But oh ! no, he deceived this poor wretch ; he never married her !"" cried Lady Blunt, with her whitening lips. ""He was too selfish, too poor ! Oh ! no, he never married her, and yet how cruel, how cruel ! He deceived her, and when he told her the truth it killed her. Yes, this was it ; my boy is all right, but still 1 will see Mr Howard. I will make sure, it is better to be sure."" And so she decided to go to London. She would make sure. She told herself that Sir Harry had but deceived Mary Fletcher ; he was a bad man, and capable of any deceit, and he bad deceived this poor woman and pretended he had married her. In one of Mary's letters she named the City Church where they had been married. Oh ! this was easily found out at any rate. Poor woman, to be so cruelly deceived ! Lady Blunt felt sorry for her dead rival, yet strangely nervous about her claims. Poor Mary, at least, had believed she was a wife — yes, this was quite plain — so Lady Blunt thought and said as she sat there shaking and trembling ; thinking of her own Harry, her own boy, with a new fear and a new protecting love. Chapter XX. What the Lawyer Knew Lady Blunt went up to London the same day she saw Dr Humphrey, accompanied by her butler and her maid. She went to a quiet Wefat End Hotel, looking on Piccadilly, and spent the first night there m restless anxiety. She had written a note to her late husband's lawyer, Mr Howard, the senior partner of a well-known firm : an old man now, but stout, fresh, aud handsome still. This gentleman was therefore prepared to receive the widowed Lady Blunt, when, on the following uiorninsj she drove down to hia offices accompanied by Appleby, whom, of course, she left in the carnage outside. She had never seen Mr Howard before. After her husband's death John Chester had always transacted all business for her, and any document lequhing her signature had been brought down to Weirmere by a clerk from the lawyer's office, and she thus was a stranger to the portly, good-natured looking man, who rose with a smile as she was announced, and held out a handsome, white hand. ""Lady Blunt?"" he said, ""I am glad to be come personally acquainted with you."" Lady Blunt only bowed ; she sat down on the chair the lawyer offered to her, and then looked somewhat nervously around. "" You wished to see me,"" continued Mr Howatd, now glancing at Lady Blunts own note lying open on the table belore him, "" and 1 think you mention some particular busi ness?"" ""Yes,"" said Lady Blunt, still nervously. ""I — I — came on some letterß lately, Mr Howard ; letters that have disturbed mo."" There flitted over the lawyer's face, as Lady Blunt said this, a new expression ; but only for one moment ; the next he asked, with his old pleasant, unconscious smile, "" And these letters : I may ask the name of the writer, I conclude ?"" Lady Blunts neutral tints and faded 6kin now flushed with a quick and sudden blush. ""The writer,"" she repeated, as if forcing herself to some unpleasant ta&k, ""is — is that uniortunate person — the mother of Sir Henry's illegitimate children."" "" But this lady has been dead many years ; died before your own marriage, Lady Blunt,"" said Mr Howard, and he cast down his eyes. "" So I conclude ; so, at least, I was told,"" said Lady Blunt, bitterly. •' I married Sir Henry in ignorance of this connexion, but I heard of it before long. It— it embittered my life!"" Mr Howard was silent ; he took up a paper cutter lying near ; he played with it ; he laid it down. "" You know the contents of my husband's will ?"" continued Lady Blunt, looking at the lawyer uneasily. "" Yes, I executed that will in accordance with written instructions I received from Sir Henry."" "" Then you know he provided for his son, Robert Fletcher, and also directed that in the event of my agent's death, that Robert Fletcher had to be appointed in his place ?"" "" I remember that clause,"" said Mr Howard, looking attentively at his finger nails "" I thus got to know this young man,"" said Lady Blunt ; ""he has been ill, and a lease, somehow, in Mr Chester's time, had become mislaid. I was searching for this lease the night before last. I opened a trunk of Sir Henry's papers that had not been opened since his death, for the purpose of looking for this lease, and I came on two packets of letters from this woman."" ""And you read them?"" asked tho lawyer, looking quickly in Lady Blunts agitated face. ""I— l— glanced at one first— l glanced at the signature. It is this signature that has caused — me to come to you, that has caused me uneasiness. This person's letters were signed — all signed — as though she had been Sir Henry's legal wife— they were signed, Your affectionate wife, Mary Blunt ! "" "" And did you gather any other information from thebe letters ?"" asked Mr Howard, slowly. ""He had deceived her, it seems !"" answered Lady Blunt, quickly and passionately. "" Yes, 1 think he had deceived her ; poor, poor un fortunate woman to trust in him ! You know what he was, Mr Howard?"" went on Lady Blunt, with rising passion. "" A faithless, dis honourable man ! He married me for my for tune ; he deceived this poor wretch, I suppose, because she had been too good to live with him on other terms !"" "" Then you are satisfied he deceived her ?"" asked the lawyer. ""Of course, I am satisfied ! If I were not satisfied — Good God ! my boy — Sir Harry — would not be heir !"" "" Not in case of this marriage,"" said the lawyer slowly. ""He dare not ! he dare not !"" cried Lady Blunt in great excitement. ""What object had he in such deceit ? Besides, by his will he left everything after my death, did he not, to my son ?"" Mr Howard made no answer. He rose and walked once or twice up and down the office ; he looked as if he were thinking very seriously, and as he went Lady Blunts anxious eyes fol lowed him, "" What do you advise ?"" she said at length, "" I think you had best let it alone,"" said the lawyer, pausing before Lady Blunts chair; "" this lady was dead before you married Sir I Henry. Sir Henry left everything to you for your life. I would leave these letters alone."" "" But. Mr Howard, do you not see,"" said Lady Blunt eagerly, "" 1 hat claims might be raised after my death ? This woman, in one of her letters, even mentioned the church — a city church— where she evidently believed she was married."" "" And you read all this ? The name of the church —everything?"" "" Yes, the name of the church was St. Jude's —yes, I read it— and I brought the letters,"" And Lady Blunt drew from her bag the two packets of letters she had tied together, and brought from Weirmere. "" These are the letters,"" she said, and she laid them down, but Mr Howard did not take them up. "" We must remember,"" he said, ""that what ever secret there was between this lady and Sir Henry it was not intended to be known to you, Lady. Blunt, and only became suspected by an accident."" ""But you do not think he really married her? ''asked Lady B unt, sharply and eagerly. "" But if you think so, for a moment think so, there is the register at this church. That would prove it, or disprove it, would it not ? "" ""Yes, but the question is, do you wish to prove it, Lady Blunt?"" "" Mr Howard,"" said Lady Blunt, rising with pride and dignity, "" if I believed that my late husband was married first to this unhappy person, and that their child was the legal heir and not my child, do you think I could live and do such a wrong as this ? All my life I have walked straight ; I will not falter now."" "" I am deeply grieved, more grieved than I can tell you, Lady Blunt. Sir Henry never meant this to come to your knowledge ; his will was especially devised to prevent it coming to your knowledge "" ""Then he married her ?"" interrupted Lady Blunt, in a sharp voice of pain. "" So I understood,"" said the lawyer ; "" but I was bound to secrecy. Sir Henry wished you never to know. He was grateful to you for the. fortune you brought him, which you with — pardon me — too generous goodness, had not settled on yourself, and as you know he left this fortune, and his own fortune also, to y n in uncontrolled possession for your life "" "" But at my death he left it to Harry, to my son ? "" interrupted Lady Blunt;, eagerly. "" Have you seen the will ? "" said Mr Howard. ""No, but Mr Chester told me of it. He said Sir Harry had ,left everything to me, then to the heir, my son ? "" "" Whom Mr Chester naturally supposed to be the undisputed heir ? Lady Blunt, I grieve much to distress you, but you know so much now I may as well tell you all at least that I know. I suppose you would rather I should do this?"" ""Yes, certainly, yes !"" ""Then Sir Harry devised his will thus. He lelt everything to you for your lifetime, with the exception of two annuities of five hundred a year each "" "" I know— to Robert Fletcher, and to Harry !"" ""To his two sons, in fact. After your death all the property now held by you goes by Sir Henry's well to the heir— the legal heir— bo it is especially named in the will, of the title. Now, if .Sir Henry married this first lady, her son "" "" Is the heir,"" said Lady Blunt, almost in a whisper, and she grew deadly pale, "" my son in this case "" ""Is but a second son ; it is a cruel case, Lady Blunt._ Sir Henry was most anxious to spare you this knowledge, but one person and myself knew of it "" •• And that one person ? "" asked Lady Blunt, with white, quivering lips. ""Is the heir. In fact the young man called Robert Fletcher; the young man you ap- I pointed "" But he was interrupted by a low wail from | Lady Blunt. "" What ! he knew — he knew 1 "" she cried. ' "" His father told him on his death-bed. He too was bound to secrecy. In your life time this never was to be known. His own sister, that beautiful girl they call Miss Fletcher, knows nothing of it."" "" Oh ! my boy ; my poor, poor boy,"" moaned Lady Blunt, and she covered her face. "" It is a cruel case,"" said the lawyer, full of pity for the unhappy mother ; ""cruel to your son, and cruel also to this other young man who has been forced into a false position by no fault of hi*B own. I wish you had never learnt this, Lady Blunt — from the bottom of my heart 1 wish you had never learnt it ! "" "" And you think there is no doubt ? "" said Lady Bluut, lifting up her white face. "" I fear not, but we can easily assure our selves. I know the Vicar of this St. Jude's Church, for I have some property in the neighbourhood, and a line to him— but shall I write it? Would yon rather know? Re member it is doing the eldest son no harm ; his future inheritance is assured."" ""And my boy disgraced and deceived!"" cried Lady Blunt, in maternal anguish, ""he had better know ; it is better he should know."" "" For one thing, yes,"" said thelawyer. ""Ex cuse me, Lady Blunt, but you have a large income. In the case of this earlier marriage being an undoubted fact, which, of course, an examination of the register of Sfc. Jude's of the day mentioned by the lady in the letters you have here will determine, — in that case I would advise that you settle the savings out of your income on your own son without delay. You have a perfect right to do this, and it will secure him in any case a handsome provision."" But Lady Blunt only made a bitter moan in answer to this suggestion. She knew well where her large savings had gone : John Ches ter had taken them ; she had scarcely anything to leave Harry. Robert Fletcher would have all. "" In the meanwhile shall I write to the Vicar of St. Jude's?"" said Mr Howard. '• Yes,"" write — write now,"" answered Lady Blunt. "" I will wait here till I know ; it is better to know the worst."" "" I wish you had not known,"" said Mr Howard again ; and then he sat down to write his letter, and Lady Blunt turned away her head. Conceive her bitterness — her misery ! Robert Fletcher th<j heir not only to his father's property, but to all the great estate Bhe had brought to Sir Henry in her fond, lavish, girlish love, when she refused to have anything -settled on herself, and trusted a worthless man alike with her money and her love ! There was no law in those days to pro tect a woman's property, and Lady Blunt knew, as she sat there, that Sir Henry's will would hold good, though ahe did not believe that Robert Fletcher would take the full ad vantage of it. "" He is good, he is noble,"" she thought, reflecting on the character of her husband's son ; "" no, he will not leave my boy in poverty, —but to think that it will be in his power!"" And Lady Blunt could not suppress a moan. Mr Howard looked round at her compassion ately. "" I have written the letter to my friend the Vicar, Lady Blunt "" he said, ""and now, with your permission, I will refer to this lady's letters about the date"" (and he took up the letters Lady Blunt had brought). ""Yes, here is the date ; but before I send this, let me again ask you, have you well considered the consequences?"" "" Yea,"" answered Lady Blunt, huskily ; "" yes, it is better in my life- time. Let me share the pain if my boy is disinherited. Yes, some arrangements for the future may be made, if this turns out true, with Mr Fletcher. 'l "" I think so,"" said Mr Howard. ""Nay, I am almost sure of it : he is a fine fellow, this young man— Sir Henry's eldest son."" The lawyer was thinking at that moment "" a very much finer fellow than Sir Henry's second son,"" for he knew young Harry Blunt through a slight business transaction, and the young man had not made a very favourable impression on the shrewd old lawyer. But he was sorry for the mother. "" I will send my letter, then,"" he said, ""with a confidential clerk, and I will ask my friend the Vicar of St. Jude's to send a copy of the register of this marriage if it took place on the date the lady mentions here "" (and he laid his hand on one of Mary's letters). ""It will take some time to make this inquiry, Lady Blunt. Will you remain here, or shall I forward the Vicar's reply to your hotel ?"" ""I will stay here,"" said Lady Blunt, "" I— i— could not bear any longer suspense."" In that case will you excuse me, for I am very busy this morning, but when the Vioar'a answer arrives I will come to you at once. In the meantime, you must have some wine "" "" No,"" said Lady Blunt, shaking her head, and then she turned her eyes to the clock standing on the mantel-piece, and, taking the hint, Mr Howard took up his letters and went away. Tick, tick, went the clock— silent mysterious time strode on— tick, tick, its indicator marked its tread. In Lady Blunts heart, too, a dull cold throb kept pace with each passing moment as it flew. She was conscious of this pain, yet her mind travelled away from it. Strange fancies seemed to possess her, and scenes from her youth came back out of the long, cold vista of the past. She remembered the first day she bad met Sir Harry, the handsome man bowing before her. He must have been a 1 married man then, now thought Lady Blunt, with a ghastly smile. She remembered when her boy was born; the warm gush of maternal love that came, like sunshine to her chilled and disappointed heart. She remembered his father never seemed to care much for the babe, and then — and then she began thinking of John Chester. ""Oh ! John, forgive me,"" Bhe prayed half aloud. She had broken her word to her dead friend ; broken it to try to save her son — Sir Harry— from a marriage beneath hia state! Sir Hairy— not Sir Harry now perhaps— a poor boy— a poor boy with no forcune— nothing — almost nothing, and Florence Chester had married him ! One after the other such thoughts flashed through her poor, labouring, aching heart. She put her hand to her side, she sighed. The clerk had been gone three-quarters of an hour, in another he might be back. The other quarter went slowly away ; then another and another. Would he never come? Lady Blunt felt sick and faint ; she would have been glad of the wine she had refused before. Somehow at this moment Bhe remembered thinking of the feelings of a man waiting to hear the verdict of the jury— life or death. "" What folly,"" she said, trying to rouse herself, ""it is not life or death, only poverty and dis grace."" The handle of the door now turned, and with a violent start Lady Blunt roae to her feet, and as she did so ""Mr Howard and a pleasant faced clergyman walked in. "" I have brought my friend, Mr Makeplace, the Vicar of St. Jude's, to see you,"" said Mr Howard ; and Lady Blunt knew, as eho heard the ring of condolence and sympathy in his voice, that Mr Makeplace had come to break the news to her — that she had been her husband's second wife I * ""What have you found?"" she had strength and courage to ask. Mr Howard shook his head, ""I have no good news, Lady Blunt,"" he said. "" Sir Henry married this first lady on the day she names in her letter, the day, after she left her father's house. Her son was born about a year later. I fear there is no doubt that he is the heir."" ""I married Sir Henry Blunt to Miss Fletcher "" began the clergyman, but with an emphatic gesture Lady Blunt stopped him. "" It is enough,' she said, ""my boy, then, ia nothing. I will go home now, Mr Howard. 1 feel rather faint. Where are my people ?"" And she staggered, and would have fallen, but Mr Howard caught her in his arms. ""My dear lady,"" he said, ""this is a great trial, but still remember it does not in the least effect your own position. The first Lady Blunt was dead before "" "" I feel rather faint,"" repeated Lady Blunt, with her bloodless lips, and then her head reeled and fell to one Bide, and Mr Howard, glancing at her face, gave a short exclamation. "" Good God !"" he said. "" Makeplace ! send for a doctor. I believe she is "" He did not utter the word, but as he paused the second Lady Blunt died in his arms, and her sad and labouring heart grew still. The shock had been too much for her they, said ; the long hours of anxiety had snapped her frail thread of life, and with one deep, gasping sigh her spirit winged itself away from her bitter cares.

There wart that about his humble mien, his tired look, his decayed -gentility clothes, that almost reached the ""mustard-seed of charity that still re mained, remote and lonely, in the empty vastneps of my heart, notwithstanding I observed a portfolio under his arm, and said to myself, ""Behold, Providence hath deli vered his servant into the hands of another canvasser."" Well, these people always get one inte rested. Before I well knew how it came about, this one was telling me his history, and I was all attention and sympathy. He told it something like this :—: — My parents died; alas ! when I was a little sinless child. My uncle Ithuriel took me to his heart and reared me as his own. He was my only relative in the wide world ; but he was good and rich and generous. He reared me in the lap of luxury. I knew no want that, money could satisfy. in the fulness of time 1 was graduated, and went with two of my servants — my chamberlain and my valet — to travel in foreign countries. During four years I flitted upon careless wing amid the beauteous gardens of the distant strand, if you will permit this form of speech in one whose tongue was ever attuned to poesy ; and indeed I so speak with confidence, as one unto his kind, for I perceive by your eyes that you too, sir, are gifted with the divine inflation. In those far lands I revelled in the ambrosial food that fructifies the soul, the mind, the heart. But of all things, that which most appealed to my inborn {esthetic taste was the prevailing custom there, among the rich, of making collections of elegant and costly rarities, dainty objets de vertu, and in an evil hour I tried to uplift my uncle Itlmriel to a plane of sympathy with this exquisite employment. I wrote and told him of one gentleman's vast collection of shells ; another's noble collection of meerschaum pipes ; another's elevating and refining collection of unde cipherable autographs ; another's priceless collection of old china ; another's enchanting collection of postage-stamps— and so forth and so on. Soon my letters yielded fruit. My uncle began to look about for something to make a collection of. You may know, perhaps, how fleetly a taste like this dilates. His soon became a raging fever though I knew it not. He began to neglect his great pork business; presently ho wholly retired and turned an elegant leisure into a rabid search for curious things. His wealth was vast, and he spared it not. First he tried cow-bolls. He made a collection which filled live large salons, and comprehended all the different sorts of cow-bells that ever had been contrived, save one. That one — an antique, and the only specimen extant — was possessed by another collector. My uncle offered enormous sums for it, but the gentle man would not sell. Doubtless you know what necessarily resulted. A true collector attaches no value to a collection that is not complete. His great heart breaks, he sells nis hoard, he turns his mind to some field that seems unoccupied. Thus did my uncle. Ho next tried brick bats. After piling up a vast and intensely interesting collection, the former difficulty supervened ; his great heart broke again ; he sold out his soul's idol to the retired brewer who possessed the missing brick. ■Then he tried flint hatchets and other imple ments of Primeval Man, but by-and-bye discovered that the factory where they were made was supplying o;her collectors as well as himself. He tried Aztec inscriptions and stuffed whales— another failure, after incre dible labour and expense. When his eollec- Uon seemed at last perfect, a stuffed whale Wmed from Oreenfancl ans an Asstfcc ta scription from the Cundurango regions of Central America that made all former speci mens insignificant. My uncle hastened to secure these noble gems. He got the stuffed whale, but another collector got the inscrip tion. A real Cundurango, as possibly you know, is a possession of such supreme value, that when once a collector gets it, he will rather- part with his family than with it. So my uncle sold out, and saw his darlings go forth, never more to return; and his coal-black hair turned white as' snow in a single night. Now he waited, and thought. He knew another disappointment might kill him. He waß resolved that he would choose things next time that no other man was collecting. He carefully made up his mind, and once more entered the field— this time to make a collection of echoes. 1 Of what ? "" said I. Echoe?, sir. His first purchase was an echo in Georgia that repeated four times ; his next was a six-repeater in Maryland; his next was a thirteen-repeater in Maine ; his next was a nine-repeater in Kansas ; his next was a twelve-repeater in Tennessee, which he got cheap, so to speak, because it was out of repair, a portion of the crag which reflected it having tumbled down. He believed he could repair it at a cost of a few thousand dollars, and, by increasing the elevation with masonry, treble the repeating capacity ; but the architect who undertoook the job had never built an echo before, and so he utterly spoiled this one. Before he meddled with it, it used to talk back like a mother-in-law, but now it was only fit for the deaf and dumb asylum. Well, next he bought a lot""of cheap little double-barrelled echoes, scattered around over various States and Territories ; he got them at twenty per cent, off by taking the lot. Next he bought a perfect Gatling gun of an echo in Oregon, and it cost a fortune, I can tell you. You may know, sir, that in the echo market the scale of prices is cumulative, like the carat scale in diamonds; in fact, the same phrase ology is used. A single-carat echo is worth but ten dollars over and above the value of the land it is on ; a two-carat or double barrelled echo is worth thirty dollars ; a five-carat is worth nine hundred and fifty ; a ten-carat is worth thirteen thousand. My uncle's Oregon echo, which he called' the Great Pitt Echo, was a twenty-two carat gem, and cost two hundred and sixteen thousand dollars — they threw the land in, for it was four hundred miles from a settle ment. Well, in the meantime my path was a path of roses. I was the accepted suitor of the only and lovely danghter of an English earl, and was beloved to distraction. In that dear presence I swam in seas of bliss. The family were content, for it was known that I was sole heir to an uncle held to be worth five millions of dollars. However, none of us knew that my uncle had become a col lector, at least in anything more than in a small way, for testhetic amusement. Now gathered the clouds above my uncon scious head. That divine echo, since known throughout the world as the Great Koh-i noor, or Mountain of Repetitions, was dis covered. It was a sixty-five-carat gem. You could utter a word and it would talk back at jox* for fifteen minutes, when the day was otherwise quiet. But behold, another discovery was made at the same time : another echo-collector was in the field. The two rushed to make the purchase. The property consisted of a couple of small hills, with a shallow swale between, out yonder among the back settlements of New York btate. Both men arrived on the ground at the same time, and neither knew the other was there. The echo was riot all owned by one man ; a person by the name of William son Bolivar Jarvis owned the east hill, and a person by the name of Harbison J. J3lcdso owned the west hill ; the swale between was the dividing line. So while my uncle was buying Jarvis's hill for three million two hundred and eighty-five thousand dollars, the other party was buying Bledso's hill for a shade over three million. Now, do you perceive the natural result ? Why, the noblest collection of echoes on earth was for over and ever incomplete, since it possessed but the one-half of the king echo of the universe. Neither man was content with this divided ownership, yet neither would sell to the other. There were jawings, bickerings, heart-burnings. And at last, that other collector, with a malignity which only a collector can ever feel toward a man and a brother, proceeded to cut down his hill ! You see, as long as he could not have the echo, he was resolved that nobody should have it. He would remove his hill, and then there would be nothing to reflect my uncle's echo. My uncle remonstrated with him, but the man said, "" I own one end of this echo; I choose to kill my end; you must take care of your own end yourself."" Well, my uncle got an injunction put on him. The other man appealed and fought it in a higher court. They carried it on up, clear to the Supreme Court of the United States. It made no end of trouble there. Two of the judges believed that an echo was personal property, because it was impalpable to sighr and touch, and yet was purchasable, saleable, and consequently taxable : two others believed that an echo was real estate; because it was manifestly attached to the land, and was nofc removable from place to place ; other of the judges contended that an echo was not property at all. It was finally decided that the echo was property ; that the hills were property ; that the two men were separate and independent owners of the two hills, but tenants in common in the echo ; therefore defendant was at full liberty to cut down his hill, since it belonged solely to him, but must' give bonds in three million dollars as indemnity for damages which might result to my uncle's half of the echo. This decision also debarred my uncle from using defendant's hill to reflect his part of the echo, without defen dant's consent ; he must use only his own hill ; if his part of the echo would not go, under these circumstances, it was cad, of course, but the court could find no remedy. The court also debarred defendant from using my uncle's hill to reflect his end of the echo, without consent', You ses the $rani result 1 Neither man would give consent, and so that astonishing and most noble-echo had to cease from its great powers ; and since that day that magnificent property is tied up and unsaleable. . A week before my wedding day, while I was still swimming in bliss and the nobility were gathering from far and near to honour our espousals, came news of my uncle's death, and also a copy of his will, making me his sole heir. He was gone ; alas, my dear benefactor was no more. The thought surcharges my heart even at this remote day. I handed the will to the earl ; I could not read it for the blinding tears. The earl read it; then he sternly said, ""Sir, do you call this wealth ? — but doubtless you do in your inflated country. Sir, you are left sole heir to a vast collection of echoes— if a thing can be called a collection that is scattered far and wide over the huge length and breadth of the American continent : sir, this is not all ; you are head and ears in debt ; there is not an echo in the lot but has a mortgage on it ; sir, lam not a hard man, but I must look t© my child's interest; if you had but one echo which you could honestly call your own, if you had but one echo which was free from incumbrance, so that you could retire to it with my child, and by humble, painstaking industry culti vate and improve it, and thus wrest from it a maintenance, I would not say you nay; but I cannot marry my child to a beggar. Leave his side, my darling; go, sir; take your mortgage-ridden echoes and quit my sight for ever."" My noble Celestine clung to me in tears, with loving arms, and swore she would willingly, nay, gladly, marry me, though I had nob an echo in the world. But it could not be. We were torn asunder, she to pine and die within the twelvemonth, I to toil life's long journey sad and lone, praying daily, hourly, for that release which shall join us together again in that dear realm where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. Now, sir, if you will be so kind as to look at these maps and plans in my portfolio, I am sure I can sell you an echo for less money than any man in the trade. Now this one which cost my uncle 10 dollars 30 years ago, and is one of the sweetest things in Texas, I will let you have for "" Let me interrupt you,"" 1 said. ""My friend, I have not had a moment's respite from canvassers this day. I have bought a sewing machine which I did not want; I have bought a map which is mistaken in all its details : I have bought a clock which will go ; I have bought a moth poison which the moth prefers to any other beverage : I have bought no end of useless inventions, and now I have had enough of this foolish ness. I would not have one of your echoes if you were even to give it to me. I would not let it stay on the place. I always hate a man who trys to sell me echoes. You soe this gun ? Now take your collection and move on ; Let us have no bloodshed,"" But he only smiled a sad, sweet smile, and got out some more diagrams. You know the result perfectly well, because you know that when you have once opened the door to a canvasser, the trouble is done and you have got to suffer a defeat. • I compromised with this man at the end of an intolerable hour. I bought two double-barrelled echoes in good condition, and he threw in another, which he said was not saleable because it spoke only German. He said, "" She was a perfect polyglot once, but somhow her palate got down.",Fiction

"" Toll me it again,"" aaid a tiny boy who was seated on the edge of a ditch, with his elbows firmly planted on his knees and his head rest ing on his two chubby hands. His old, bat tered straw hat waa pushed to the back of his head, and his dark blue eyes were gazing earnestly into the face of a girl seated opposite to him. Her face was shaded by a clean sun bonnet, and from under it long flaxen ringlets hung down almost to her waist. She was knit ting a blue stocking very earnestly. The boy was Jamie, and tho girl Lintie. ""Tell me it again, Lintie,"" and in hor own sweet way Lintio told the talo of Dick Whittington and his Gat. Long after she was finished Jarnie remained lost in thought. They were herding cows, and at their feet sat Bubs, their faithful little slave. Bubs was a terrier ; his coat o thick, short hair was of a colour which most resembled a withered orange. Bubs' eye was fixed on an old roan cow, an awful fence breaker ; and Bubs' duty was to keep his eye fixed on her, and whenever she headed towards tho fence turn her back. Many a long day had Jamie and Lintie spent in this spot. Sometimes they played shop keeping, with black earth for tea and yellow clay for sugar, clover for bread and sorrel for butter. At othor times, while Liutie knit her stocking she told Jamie simple little tales. Their mother was a widow, her husband hav ing died shortly after Jamie's birth. She had a few acres of land, and tried to eke out her slender income by keeping a few cows and making butter. There waa a large tract of land near her which had never been occupied. j In summer the grass on it was very rich, so she allowed her cows to run there, while Jamie and Lintie watched and prevented from break ing into^fche neiyhours' fields or straying too t far from home. They were as loving a brother and sister as one could wish to see. They never quarrelled. This was owing, I think, to Lintie's being so much older than Jamie, he beiu^ six and she twelve. They never saw any other children, and had never been more than four miles irom home in their life. For a long time after Lintie had stopped talking Jamie remained lost in thought ; then he suddenly raised his head, and said : ""Lintie, how long will it bo afore I am a man ?"" "" A long, long time, Jamie."" ""Well, 1 will make a lot of money, and you and mother will never need to work, and will wear as grand frocks as the minister's wife."" The minister's wife waa the grandest lady of Jamie's acquaintance. ""Jamie,"" said Lintie, ."" there's old ICate trying to break into Peat's wheat ; run, like a man, and turn her back."" Jamie sprang to his feet, and Bubs followed him. They soon succeeded in turning Kate back. J ust as he was about to seat himself again, a rabbit darted out of a patch of fern near, and ran almost across his feet. With a loud yell, Jamie set after it, and Bub 3 followed suit. Away they went through the turnips arid across another field, until they disappeared in a gully. Liutie called to him to come back once or twice, but he never heard her. Lintio sat down, and went on with her knitting, until the sun was almost setting. Seeing no sign of Jamie's return, she stuck her needles into her wool, rolled her stocking up, gathered the cows together, and started for homo. She turned several times and called Jamie, but received no answer. When she reached home she found hor mother waiting for her at the stockyard gate. ""Where is Jarnie, my lass?"" she asked as she noticed Jamie's absence. It was rare for them to come home sepai ately. ""He went through Peat's turnips after a rabbit, and he's no' back,"" answered Lintip, driving the cows into the yard. They milked the cows, -and still no signs of Jamie. While her mother fiuished the outdoor work. Lintie went indcoi's and prepared the supper. She made tea for her mother, in a tiny teapot, and sot two basins of now milk for herself and Jiunie. Her mothor came in and, waahiug her hands, sat down to her tea. "" I wonder what's keepin' the laddie,"" she said when the tea was over, and still no Jamie. Lintie proposed they should go out and meet him, so tying on their bonnets they set forth. They did not lock the dooi-, as strangers were scarce in those parts ; besides, there was noth ing in the house worth carrying away. They went slowly down to the gate. Here they stood talking for a little while, and then they sauntered on. "" Mother,"" said Lintie, breaking a long silence, ""do you think any thing's happened Jamie ?"" And she looked anxiously up into her mother's face, which looked clouded and anxious. "" Something's keepin' him,"" she answered. "" He would na be awa' a' this time for nao tbing."" 11 I'll call him,"" suggested Lintie. "" Jamie, Jamie !"" she called, and her clear sweet voice rang through the still evening air. But there was no answer. Again and again she called with the same reßult. They came to Peat's turnips, and on to the stubble. It was turn ing rapidly dark, and poor Mrs Allan began to be very uneasy. Jamie had never boen out so late in his life before. "" Oh, Lintio, Lintie,''' she said in a quivering voice, "" surely he' no' fallen into the crook."" "" There's no water in it, mother,"" aaid Lintie reassuringly. It was so dark they could hardly see a hand's breadth in front of them, but still they wandered up and down, straining eye and ear to catch the first sight or sound of the missing one.

Across the rock, though it was ticklish work, all went well, but when we were half-way over, what we thought had been soft snow proved to be a little snow field, hanging almost perpendicularly against the wall of tho lvsck, and as hard aa ice on the surface. Simon sug gested turning back, and did all in his power to dissuade me from crossing it, but as he ex pressed his own ability to cros3, I made up my mind to follow him rather than make tha long journey round. So, digging footholds with hia alpenstock as he went, Simon led the way until we were half across. Here one of my feet slipped, and before I knew what had happened, I heard a scvr>am from the Svan, and found myself gliding easily, but at an awful pace, down the slops. In a moment I knew all was ever with me, and in that moment I learnt how man's mind can work when it is wound up to its full power of concentration. I saw the whole shape of the slope like a man's legs with the loft ono cut off at tho knee, and there an end, with a drop of perhaps 500 ft on the iron edges of the rocks beneath. The other limb of the snow slope was too long for me to know what waa at its end. Every story of Swiss mountaineering which I had aver read fhshed through my brain, and sticking to my alpen stock, I drove the point with both hands into tho snow between my legs in front of me. But though the shaft waa of seasoned boxwood, it snapped so short and suddenly that I never felt the shock of it. Clinging to what was loft, I now saw just at the crutch of the two legs a big stone welded into the snow. Using my broken stick with all my might as a pole, I tried to punt myself away from the short road to destruction towards which I was rushing headlong, and so succeeded that get. ting my foot against the stone, before 1 could draw another breath I was whirling off the longer limb into a bed of snow beneath. Clean out of sight I sank, but though breathless, shaken, and blinded, I crawled out again in a few moments waotically unhurt, and deeply grateful to the Providence that had saved me. The etory of such a slip taken a long time telling, but though my slide, was perhaps a hundred yards long, from the timp. J knew I was under way to tho time 1 reappeared irom my snow covoriug, could not have been more than a matter pf moments. At;d yet with tbe fear of death before me, my mind could not only provide what was besb ior mv own safety, but review my past and think of the future of those at home. After that it did not eeem hard for me to understand the possibility of that mind of the univciMo, whici knows all our thoughts and at ono moment of time hru in Its infinite grasp what was, and what is, and what is to come. Singing out to the Svau not to come down, I proceeded to climb up the edpre of my enomy the snow slope, and having got to tho place where we had begun our line of foot-holds, crossed again, and this time in safety, though the entreaties of my frightened guide worried me enough all the way across to have made a second slip quite a possible contingency.

Sir, — Being impressed with the value and importance of the mineral wealth of Now Zeal v.d, and of this Pro vince in particular, 1 deem it essential to aflbid some in formation on the suhject. Amongst the various minerals in which this Province abounds, manganese, cobalt, lead, silver, gold, and copper ore of various dpsci'^i'ons, uv* known to exist. Previous to the suspension of the Kawau mine opeia tions, in 1852, by reason of inefficient machinery, copper ore had been realized to the value of'i'3o,ooo. The work ing of these mines was resumed in 1851, with the requisite aid of machinery, but owing to incidental occuirencea, ope ratioi s were abandoned after a few months' continuation. It is much to be regretted that the Company allowed the machinery to be removed off the mine, thus depriving other parties of the opportunity of further prosecution. It is be lieved that \ast quantities, of copper ore exist in these mines, which, it is thought, would be verified if the bottom level (3<l fathoms below the adit) had been extended westward, one course of the lode, where the ground was favourable Jor driving, instead of abandoning the mine without opening a single fathom in that direction. With reference to the Great liairier Minrs. This un dertaking is progressing favourably ; although b^ing worked on a limited scale it is making protiu'b c and satis factory returns. Duiing the puiod in which I have, jointly with Mr. Rowe, been the lessee (bein:> a little over 12 months), copper ore has been lealized to tie value ot of £10,000, giving a good piofit to the parties interested. I am also particularly impressed with the importance to the colony of the opening of the Coromandel gold-ficliU, especially with rebpect to the working ot the auniarous quartz, and think measures should be taken by tl.c Go vernment, without delay, to extinguish tiu Native title over all or any part of the <iiscnct iv which gold has been found.

In the application of hi; argument your cor respondent assumes for the benefit (';) of your readers that Mr Like, who wears his colours openly as an opponent of the pre sent Government, is therefore "" pledged In vote as the leader of the Opposition shall dictate * * and who will lie obedient to the call of the leader of the Opposition re gardless of his own convictions and the wishes of his constituents."" (fas your correspondent any justification for such an assumption as this? 1 venture to say ho has not. Does he boliove. it himself? Again the answer must be X"". Or is it the case that knowing better himself he is trying to mislead the electors by perverting and distorting the position. ""Julian"" does not require to be told— ho knows it well—that in all organised political oppo sitions thei e is a freedom of action among its members which, as a rule, is unknown among Government supporters. A pledged supporter of the Government might well be ""dictated to"" by his leader, but a member of the Opposition, although acting ill concert with others to secure common ends is, as compared with a Government supporter, a free lance. ""Julian"" known this well, but the unfair ness of his argument, hue mi is in ire mani fest when we rellect that an avowed Government supporter, with a good chance of being returned, would have had nothing but approval and support trom him. There need be no doubt of this—it will not be denied—but it is curiously inconsistent with ""Julian's "" present attitude. Your correspondent proceeds to say that "" it has always been the independent members who have dimu the work of Parliament."" This italeiiient is so exactly and absolutely con trary to well known and established fails that it would be ail insult to the know ledge and intelligence of ""Julian "" to sup pose that he has the slightest belief in his statement. In Great Britain, and in all its colonies where constitutional government exists, "" the real work of Parliament "" is done by the majority in power, aided by the Opposition, if the latter does its duty; but constitutionally the independent mem ber bus no place, and practically he must either be useless or drawn over to the Government of the day. The latter con sideration is doubtless the one which at the present moment weighs with ""Julian,"" but it cannot justify such a perversion of the position he has placed before your readers. The cause must inde >d be a weak one which requires to be so supported.—l am, Sc., Ohskuvek. TO THK JCDITOK. fin:, — Vour correspondent. ""Julian"" in his last letter accuses Mr Like o; not hav. ing criticised the Government measures and not enunciating any policy of his own. "" Julian "" is evidently trying to throw dust in the eyes of your readers for any one who listened to the plain, practical, and sensible speech delivered by Mr Lake must admit that throughout it was a hostile criticism of the Government and its proposals. He re viewed the linancial administration showing the extravagance instead of retrenchment of the Government pointing out how the indebtedness of the colony was being in creased in a covert manner. The Lr.id Pill, the incidence of taxation, the Pavment of Members Pill, were all dealt with ad versely, indeed it was a relict to hear Mr Like after reading the frothy clap-trap and the crude notions of the half educated faddists who are now ruling the country. Nero fiddled while Koine was burning and we have much the same spectacle in New Zealand now. Population and capital are leaving the colony daily; property of all kinds is depreciating in value ; wages have fallen so low that men can scarcely main tain their families and the Liberal Legisla ture of which ""Julian"" is so enamoured instead of seeking for means to restore confidence are devoting the whole of their tune to the discission of political fads, and making New Zealand the laughing-stock of the world. Now, "" Julian "" asks what is Mr Lake's policy. It is easily answered. It runs through all his speech and all his actions; it is rigid ecor.umv in administration ; it is crushing with an iron hand all experimental and Socialistic politics, and restoring prosperity to the country by restoring confidence in it This can only be done by plain, practical legislation on business lines. ""Julian"" endeavours to be sarcastic with Mr Lake's answer re Vailo's railway scheme, but the answer was a straightforward one. I have lisard hundreds of people talking about this scheme—many of them supporting it —hut I never yet met with anyone who said they understood it. Perhaps, ""Julian,"" it will not be too severe a task upon your great mind to explain it. And now for the concluding pirtion of ""Julian's'' letter and his remarks about the Indepen dent candidate, and here it is necessary to read between the lines. ""Julian"" is not supporting the Independent candidate be cause he has a policy and a backbone, but just the reverse. ""Jnlian"" thinks, and I quite agree with him, that a man who can trim his utterances and his policy no as to try and suit both parties in order to catch votes will be easily amenable to such influ ences as the present Government can bring to baar, and it is bccause ""Julian"" thinks he is voting for a Government sup porter that his votrt will be recorded for the Independent candidate. On the other hand, the great bulk of the electors in Waikato will voto for Mr Lake, because they be hove in his integrity and sterling worth ; in short, that lie has an honest policy and a staunch backbone.—l am, etc., T.

I picked ’em up just outside the parson’s while you were in sight. ‘ Hallo ’ says 1, the Young ’an got these from the valley. Then it came over me that yon weren’t the Kind of man to waste your time foolin’ after wild flowers, though you might casual like while you were on the work, and when I see they were the valley flowers, why Neville rose. Quite so, he said. 1 Never mind, said Eockit, with a rougn attempt at consolation. Take a claim and go in with the rest of us. Neville looked thoughtfully at the plain, which bad been transformed from a soli tude to a human ants’ nest, and shook hie head. Not to-day, anyhow, he said quietly. Well, I can understand that, saidLockh. with a nod. 1 should feel just the saren as you do. It is hard, when you think you’ve got a bit all to yourself, to find that you’ve got to share it. Have a drink. Neville took a very small sip of the proffered liquor. Here’s luck to you, ho said, handed tin flask back to its owner, and walked away. Sylvia looked up and started, as, an hour or two later, be walked into the hut. Jack He nodded and smiled gravely; The men—all of them—are in the val ley, he said. Oh, Jack. He was silent for a moment, and she, with a woman’s true instinct, was silent too ; but her beautiful eyes poured out sympathy. What will you do now, Jack ? she asked almost in a whisper- Go to England, he said. The colour rushed lo her face }> and an exclamation of delight broke from her lips; then the colour faded. And—and Miss Mary, Jack ? He coloured, and his face grew almost stern. Let Miss Mary alone. Syl, he said. She is nothing to either of us ; but she’s too good a gir! to be hated for nothing. She looked at him for a moment: then her face cleared, and a look of relief shorn in her eyes. I don’t hate her any longer, .Tack, she murmured humbly. Now that we’re go ing, she added with delicious naivete. And when are we going, Jack ? To-'day, he said. Hush ! 1 have thought it all out coming home. We most go ofE quietly. There must be no brass band, You understand, Syl Not even old Meth must know, for she talks. Listen: Send her down to the camp on some service that will keep her there, then pacic up. It will only bo a bundle that I can carry with mine. We’ll soon reach Wildfall, exchange the gold for notes or letters on the bank, and join the first escort party for Ballarat. Then—his grave face lighted np —then hurrah for old England. They made their preparations: Jack coolly and deliberately, Sylvia with sup pressed excitement, which would have dis covered their purpose to old Meth if she had been sharper eyed ; and at dusk, Meth being still away at the camp, the two started. Neville had securely fastened the precious bag of gold to his belt, and care fully examined and loaded his revolver. He had thought of buying a couple of horses, but decided that it would attract attention, and possibly give the rangers notice of his departure. Besides he felt averse to lessening the treasure for which he had worked so hard, Sylvia stood for a moment, and looked back at the hut with a strange sensation fluttering at her young heart. She was saying good-bye to the rough place for ever, and—well, somehow, she knew that she had been happy there, and that happi ness does not always follow one’s foot steps. They were both rather silent as they walked, at first slowly and then quickly, in the direction of the woods, through which they must pass to Wildfall, and Neville did not tell her how the secret of the vallev had been discovered. What ‘a good thing it is moonlight, Jack, she said at last How lovely it is. Hem, yes, he assented, but rather doubtfully, If the moonlight enabled them to get along quickly and comfortably, it would also enable the rangers, if there should be any about, to see the two wanderers. They reached the woods and Neville called a halt, and they sat down and ate some sanwiches which Sylvia had packed up. It’s like a picnic, isn’t it ? she said. Her spirits had risen with every yard they had put between them and Miss Mary Brown ; and she began to sing in a low, rippling voice. Hold hard ! said Neville with a smile. That voice of yours carries a long way, Syl, and I’m not anxious for company. She laughed. What is there to bo afraid of, Jack f she said. But I won’t sing if you don’t want me to, though I feel—well, I feel just brimming over with happiness. Fancy you and me in England. Yes, said Neville; but we are not there yet. Ho took out his pips and filled it, but instead of lighting it put it back in his pocket; he remembered that the smell of tobacco also carries a long way. But Sylvia did not notice the action, and sat munching her sandwich and taking little sips from the water flask as if indeed she were at a picnic, Neville looked up at the moon presently- Are you rested enough, Sylvia ? he ssksd* Rested! Why. I wasn’t the least bit tired, she replied. Come on, then, he said. We’ve got a long walk before us, and He stopped suddenly, for his sharp ears had caught the sound of v. breaking twig. Sylvia was fastening her shawl round her, humming all the while below her breath. She was, as she had said, so happy. And how could she be otherwise, all alone with Jack in that lovely moonlight, ami no Mary Brown near? It was just like old rimes, before that young lady had appeared ; and when she. Sylvia, had had Jack all to herself. I’m ready, she said. !

The Elector says what will save the country is nationalise the lun'i and let the State have tho un earned increment. He says the profound thinkers of the day are studying this question. I say the profound fools are doing so. There is no unearned increment, there never has been any ; true there has been thought to be so and in a few instances by a fluke there has been unearned increment acquired, but flukes don t count and go for nothing This cry of unearned increment has been the ruin of hundreds, the cry made thein believe theie was unearned increment, they acted upon this supposition and so were ruined. Tlia author of this cry has a lot to answer for, he has been the cause of anguish and heartrending suffering. A fo-.v years ago, one of tho same way of thinking as elector, said to inn as a leason for the land to belong to the State was that God made the land, but that other property such as his was made by his industry. I at once replied that God as much made his industry as he made the land. This staggered him, but it did not alter his opinion. Convince a man against his will, and ho is uncon vinced still. This saying the land belongs to the people is a thing which c.innot bo. Parnell is not giving the land to the people, he only w,.nts to give it to the present tenants ; the poor labourers, who have no land will still remain poor and will be much worse off than befare, because there will bo no big landlords. m p a big landlord to work for, so say I. JMector says the land should bear all the taxes, he prefers a land tax to a property tax. i hold that the property-tax is the fairest of all taxation. A property-tax includes all pro perty in land, and all other property. ISow, this may suit storekeeper.- 1 , factors, lawyers, Parsons, and.

If you feel incline i for some hard walking, I can promise you a woodcock or two. Lte'ieve there are some first-rate snipe marshes about here. Try to come, old fellow —the sooner the 1 etfcer. Any war, you will get a hearty welc >me—tli t you know ! ' Yours truly, ' C. Tniters.' I found this letter upon my breakfast-table one morning t,owa p ds the end of October, 18—. My people and Charles Traver-'s people had been friend* for more than one generation. Charles Travers and I bad always been friends when we met ; but he had a large property in Amorici—in of the Southern St-ues — ond in consequence was little in England. I working hard amidst ibe bu-t'e and turmoil of London wirh whit I cons : d*red verv molerate results, while the fortune that h ■ and !)is partner were making on the other side of the Atlantic was fast becoming pro vfrhial among«t his friends and acquain tances Wo hail, ho > ever, several bonds in common. One of these was love of sport. 'I cdl that, a piece of luck!' I said to mvself as I threw down tho open letter. * Mo>t certainly I will come, oldfel'ov! I kno» I shall get a hearty welcome and some thing el-e, too, or my name's not Lovell Stanley !' And I drew my chair up to the breakfast-table feeling uncommonly fortunate as I reflected upon ' woodcock,' ' snipe mardvs,' et ccetrra, and a certain 'Wrstley Richards,'a breech-loader, whose value in my eyes is ' above rubies,' and whose actual cost only the year before ha i rither crippled my resources. I decided to start the next day. ' Dress suit, sir P Mason, a sor tof factotum ( f mine, looking up from an open portmanteau, which he was rapidly filling rum a c 'aos of things !ving up in ' he tl >or. ' H'm —yos put it in, Masm!' I replied. ' Don't suppose I shall want it though,' I mused. ' Travers being a bachelor, there are not likely to be any ladies "" Place on the Doley, North Wales."" Sounds out of the way, too. I know old Travers won't dress if he can help it !' I left Eu«t.on by th. 1 night train, and found myself *t a pretty little roadside Nation about noon on the following day. A dog-cart and groom were awaiting me, and we were soon outside the little station, and proceeding at the beg'pice of a smart Welsh cib along o-e uf the ni ist beautiful roads I ever remember to have sear. uloked at with the eve of an art's', how magnificent those masses of wood —I ought rather to c ill them fore> t—appeared, still clad in much of their 1 ifo autumnal glorv, broken here and there hy bold rocks, and backed up by tho more dist int. lin> of blue mountain! Looked at with the eye of a sportsman, how delightful to roam through them, far ami wide, gun in hand ! 'Ah, what a place for woodook up t'uit, dingle there, beside that little mountain stream that comes foaming and fretting down the rocks, across th 1 rial, and down into another dingle below ! There, I suppose, it runs on im'il it, j »ins the river winding yon ler through the valley. A very respect able river, I dare say. but i' doesn't look much so far below. I suppose the snipe marshes will lie in that direction.' A bii Men Mirn to the left interrupted my soliloquy We were in a narro v lane, with thick wood on one side, and » gor<ey, rushy meadow on the other. ' Have we far t<> go P' T asked. 1 Not far, sir,' the groim ropli""d, and ho pointed with his whip to a mass of woo I about half way down to tV valley. 'The house is just in there, bu' the leaves isn't off enough to sej i"" yet, «ir.' We were depending all the time un commonly pteep hiils. too ; but the sure (loti-d We'sh cib male nothing of them. Pri'S iitly we turned between two rough-hovn »tnne pillars into a drive—a wonderfully long lriv« Tn spito of its beauty, I could nj' help wnnlrrinsr when its windings and turnings would cease. 1 By jo»e. the hnise at list! ' I muttered to myself, as a large, three-storeyed, flat-fronted mansion came within view—ugly, but no doubt capacious and comfortable. A moment later I and my belongings were depos : ted at the door. A smart servant bore them away to unknown regions, and another smart servant usher'd me into a most luxuri ous and delightful dining-room. Luncheon was on t' e table. My eye took in at once surloin of beef, tongue, L'ume-Die, •weets, and—flowers upon the table ! 'Glad I brought my dr.'ss coat! ' I said to myself. ' Those flowers aren't like old Travers —looks as if there might be ladies here, after all ;' «nd T turned to a long mirror and sur veyed myself somewhat ruefully. ' My master will be in almost imme liately, sir,' observed the smart servant, and there upon disappeared wiMi silent celeritv. I had not long to wait; a minuto later Travers entered the room He chsped my hand in warm and hearty welcome. He was a tall, broad-shouldered man, about ten years older thmi myself. Calling him old is only facon d' parler, not more than forty. His face was tanned by a hotter sun than ours ; but the natural fairness of com plexion wss apparent in his blue eyes and chestnut hair, which curled close to his head with a crisp, wire-like glitter. His featur s were fine and clearly cut, altogether he was a handsome man. 'Uncommonly glad to see you, Stanley!' he exclaimed, as he shook my hand. 'Came by the night train of course? Quite right, too —saves time. You're looking as fit as possible, old fellow, in spite of the journey ; but I dare sav yni're tired, and luncheon won't come amiss. Oh, nonsense, have some thing before you change—chmge afterwards. Sit down.' I lookel at the tempting luncheon; but that imagined female presence might even now be approaching. The idea discomfited me. ' Thanks !' I returned hastily. • I must make myself presentable first. Have you asked any—any other fellows, Travera ? ' This question included the * fellows'' possible feminine belongings; but Travera was evi dently not a thought-reador. He looked at me in some surprise. 'Only Perez, my partner's son,' ho ex plained ; ' he has been in Liverpool for some time. I asked him last week—he has been here three or four days.' ' Ah,' I unswerrd carelessly, os I left the room in the wake of a smart servant, who conducted me to a comfortable room on the first, floor, with a magnificent view of moun tain, wood, and river. After a bath and change of clothes, I felt another man, and joined Travers in the dining-room, prepared to do ample justice to the good fare awaiting me. We took luncheon alone, however, and after that we retired to Travel's sanctum, where we enjoyed a long chat upon many and various subjects. We had not met for some yeara ,ao the fortunes and doings of different friends and acquaintance?, matters of business ard pleasure, profit and loss, were discussed, os we leaned back in our cu'hioned chairs and puffed at cigars, of grout, size, and equal excellence, thoroughly enjoying cursives as the time slipped by. Travers at length consulted hi* watch"" 'What do you say, old fellow, to a look round, eh ? It's early yet, and wc might take our guns—just for a stroll, you know ? ' « Nothing I should like better,' I replied. In a short time we worn teidy, and I accompanied him to tbe large oretnises at the back of the home. Wo wai'ed there a minute or two whiL a couple of spatupls > ! nd a re triever w. ro loo?ed. They were to go with There seemed to be a great uuny dogs of different sir's and sizes kept, for as the three came scouring towards us a cla nour of disap pointment and expostulation rnse in different notes and keys from the kennels. Amongst them a peculiar melancholy sound rang out like the tone of a deep bell. ' What i-<—that ?' I a*ke as the ominous sound rose aigain and died s'owly away. 'That? Oh. that's the b'oodhound ! He's pure a Cuban—a grand fel'ow to\ but ferocious. These people are afrail of him ; but I have a man here, old Fphraim tfrpen, lie's a sort of overseer at Sonvrvil'e—my place, you know —who can do anything with him. A genuine Yankee, old Ephraim, one of the cutest < f the cute. "" Wasn't born yesterday —nor yet the day before,"" as he will take ore to let vou know, if he gets the chance ; "" and Travers whistled to tho dogs as lie led the way to a short cut, to the woods, through which we were to reach a place called bv the extraordinary name of' Craig Ooch,' which I believe in We'sli means the 'red rock ' It was a lovely afternoon, and tho scenery locked all the more fascinating for the snfr autumnal hnze whi di lay like a golden veil upon mountain and valley. From the deep woods nea-est home came the rich ' cor-r.eek,' 'cor-reeck.' of the cock pheasant, as he called to hi* mates No* and th?n the round brown body and little white tail of a rabbit dar'ed across our p .th and disappeared amongst the brown and gold«u bracken, much to tho per turbation of the spaniels, which were in a constant state of disappointed expectation. Craig Cocli however, was our destination, and not a shot would we fire until we reached it. We c une at last to a sort of ulsde in the wood A cleir stream ran through it, foaming and swirling round r >ek an•' hou'der, as it, hurried along Or, the otlrr side, the wood*—still clad in much crimson and gold -seemed to rise o i rocky terraces one ■■ b ive another. ' We s' a'l have a scamble up there.' I thought as we cros j e ite stream, balancing upon rather slippy ?tep ling-stoneg. Rut ir was not such a climb as I had fancie I ; the paths zig-zajg'd upwards, rising from terrace to terr ie< They were eirpeted w;th fallen leave l , an I almost overgrown with bracke-- a-d fern. Hero under shelter of the rock""—escaping almost anv touch of frost— many different ferns seemed still to flourish, raiding their fea'hery heads in misses of a size and luxuriince that surprised me. Here and there overhanging rocks seemed to close the I way altogether ; but one generally found upon reaching the spot that the pathwiy passed round, and continued the same on the other side, still rising upwar 1. Tracers and I were approaching a place like this. A great trass of grey rock, festooned with hanging sprays of small-leafed ivy, and crowned with a delica'c silver birch* rose abruptly about a hundred ynr is in front of us. We had almost reached it when one of the spanieU gave a short bark, and, rushing for war 1 with a violent wagging of his stumpy tail, . 1 i••• ippeare 1 on th"" other side. He was followed bv his companion, but the well broken retriever came in ' to heel,' not daring to act without orders. I con r ess I was seized with asudlen feeling of curiosity. What was on the other side of that grey rock ? I quickened my pie"", followin» close upon Travers, as we turned the ma s § and stood upon the pathway beyond. And there my eyes fell upon a picture that I shall never forget while I live. Higher un on the rocky path, with the spin e's fawning at hnr feet, stood a young girl, slender and stately, dresse-l in >»ome soft white tnaleriil, and with her dark head unc ivered. She was holding a shady hat—turned into a baskot for the occasion, and filled to overflowing wi'h tinted leaves and berries—high in both hands to keep it out of the way of the demonstrative spaniels. 1 lookei at Travers in surprise but his eyes were fhedhipon the girl, and I thought his br ,ws contracted as he looked. The trick ws habitui! with him; si ill ir struck me curiously at the moment. Suddenly Travers raise! his v >ice. ' TheV he exclaimed, addr-es-i g th 1 girl, ' what are you doing up there ? ' Surely the voico wis cold, if not stern. She stood for a moment as though un certain, then, with a light, but rather hesi tating s'ep, came do vn tho steep path to wards us. My ideal woman was fair, but this girl 1 forcibly arrested my attention. I was glad her eyes were downcs' as s'ie approached us, 1 otherwise she might have thought my c!o*e observation rtido. A «weet face, with mark d black brows, delicate features, clenrly cut as Travers's own. but deeid >dly a dark gi""l. Her face wis brown, so wer<» the little hands that held the hat —i soft sjrt of egg-shell brown. I could not so her eyes yet; they were hilden by the longest, most remark ible black lashes I had ev*-r s°en. The next moment she had joined us. Travers awaited her explanation in silence, and I saw a sen j itivo little quivor upon her lip as shu hastened to speak. ' I— -I was gathering these'—holding the hat with its pre ty contents towards him. He ecarcely looked at them. ' Flumph ! ' he muttered, and then came a pause. ' Theo,' he began abruptly, ' this h my friend, Mr. Lovell Stanley,'—the girl raised her dark eyes—such eyes !—full and liquid—' mv fr'end, Mr. Lovell Shnley, of whom you have often heard me speak,' con tinued Travers. 'Stanley, this is my daughter, Miss Travers.' I was literally struck dumb with amaze ment Travel marriel! Travers with a grown-up daughter! Still I (litter myself that I bowed with all the sang-froid that England requires of her sons in suc'i circum stances. She acknowledged my bow with a timid, graceful little bend, and turned to qo, her father making no effort to detain her. As I made my second ceremonious bow—so close upon the first —I caught her eye, and fancied it lighted up with a sudden ehj smile of amusement. Th« next moment she wa< gone, and I saw her white figure disappear behind I the grfy rock, which seemed suddenly dark and cold—perhaps because it lay directly between us and the low light of the western sun. Travers and I walked on towards ' Craig Coch' in a silence which to me was rather embarrassing. I resolved to breah it. 'By Jove, Tr< vers.' I exclaimed, 'you have aniaz- d uie ! Never hnd the least idea you were a happy "" Benedict ""—and with a grown-up daughter too ! Shouldn't be in the least surprised now if you were to introduce to a bevy of them—all as beautiful as princesses in the Arabian Nights ! ' Travers's face was fixed and cold. ' I have only one, thank Heaven !' he replied. This was riot encouraging. Dscidedly dumped, I turned my attention to scrambling up the path, wlr'ch was becoming s'eoper as we approached the higher terrace of rock, behind which, so Travels informed me, lay ' Craig Coch.' My companion came up with no a l * we stood upon tlie summit.. A fairly level stretch of close mossy turf lay m front of us, sloping gradually towards the valley, between thick woo'ls on Oith-r hand It w *s marked here and there by low ft one wa'ls nnd broken by small boulders of reck that cropped up abruptly, half covered with gorse and under wood. ' That is "" Craig Coch,'"" said Tra vers, pointing towards a curious red rock that rose steeply from n little wooded dell. apparently at the extreme nnd of th n slorin upon which we were standin?. Just below it lay the river. Tts summit, broken and splintered, pointed sharply up intr the still autumn sky. ' Strange looking rock,' I observed. It is, Travprs answered absently; then, suddenly laying his hind on my arm Stanley, mv r'ear fellow, T daro sav you thought I spoke strangely just now. The— the fact, is that, a' far as I know, my friends in England had never heard of my marriage. It was a mistake, Stanley—a bitter, fatal mistake ! I was only a hoy—as you trpy have heard when I first went out to Americi. and, like the young fool that. T was, fell in lov? ! Fell in love with a haK-cas'e, and married her! No good ever came yet, Stanley, of the admixture of wh teand dar' races. Ther are as different morally »s physic illy. What can one know of the pa*? ions and proclivitie> that come on one n'de at least, from an utterly unknown ancestry p \fy experience of half cast.es is peculiatly unfavourable.

But lh""re is the tfirl! ' ' And she is y<mr daughter, Travers Cm you forget I liit. ? Her features remin le Ime of yours at firs pight. P.» «r girl, pw girl! ' He smiled coldly.

I calle 1 hack to TYavers, ns the same evening, disencumbered of hrary boots nnd gaiters, I ran rnpHly np-stairs preparatory to dreading for dinner. Fortunately lam a quirk dresser. T was verv quick this particular evening ; 1 even had time to look from my window before I went down, and notice the wonderful effect, of brilliant moonlight upon the scenery. Every thing wis bathed in silver. The river looked like a silver rihb m winding through the v tlley below Distant moun'ain-'ops loomed, nusteriotis and gigantic, through silver veils.

Above the clamour, and distinct from it.cime the deep bay of the bloodhound. I gave a sudden involuntary shiver, and turned awav from the window. It. would never, never do to stand there indulging in fancy, with the fact of a doling di'-.ner an i an impatient host awaiting me belo*. T was first in 'lie drawi""g-ro/>m, however, c and c mgritul ited myself upon »he factual looked round. A bright fi>-o s-mt mv melan- t cholv fancies to the '»inds. Th* room was t handsome, and the furniture also, though ntlier old-fashioned. I could s* l at a glance that it had bem supplemented by many ( luxurious modern additions, and all sorts <>f pretty knick-knacks were scattered about. What pleaded ine pirtimlarlv wis the 1 arrangement of flowers, tinted leaves, and ' berries which filled every vase and ll >wer stand. The contrasts wese exquisite, the , work—so it seemed to mc—of some one who loved and appreciated niturc. Hot-house flowers were not wuiting. The next thing I noticed was an open piano, a ' 2r»nd,' ono of Broadwood's best, as I ascertained by softly touching the keys. It was covered with niUMC and songs. So tl ere was someone there who 1 >ved music. Tho disco rerv delighted tne, and I I thought at once of 'he di»rk girl I had seen in the wood. She, I felt sure had arranged those lovely leaves and (lowers. She T felt sure must love music. If only h n r voice should happen to match her face. I picked up a song and looked at a namo written thereon. ' Antonio Perez.' So it was the partner's so i who sang, and no"" Mis< Travers. I put down the song with a feeling of disappointment,. and as I did so the door was gently opened and close 1 again, and so ne one came up the long room. Not Travers— not so tall. This was a younger man, witk thin square shoulders and a supple-looking fi 2 ure— a figure set off to the best advantage by perfect fitting dress-clothes. His face was handsom°, though inclining to be sallow, and his hair and moustache were jet black. The latter was waxed and twisted up at the ends. He came up to me at once, introducing himself easily and pleasantly as ' Antonio Perez.' His smile showed perfect teeth, and lie seemed to t&ke me in with one glance of a pair of remark ibly brilliant eyes. ' You are deoiiedly handsome, my young friend,' I thought—' just the sort of fellow a girl would admire.' Whether men would find him equally charming was a question 1 left undecided. This is what I thought. Needless to say, I replied politely to his easy pleasant remarks, and we were getting on, as they say, ' like u house on firr,' when the door opened again. Travers this time, and beside him a statoly personage about fifty, attired in voluminous and shining black sitin. She swept towards us in silent impressive t dignity, drawin? her lengthy train behind j hfr.

Love came a beggar to her gate, The night was drear the hour was late And through the gloom she heard his moan Where at the gate he stood alone. His rounded form in rags was clad, His weeping eyes were wan and sad; But hid beneath his garb of woe He bore his arrows and his bow. She wept to see the beggar weep. She bade him on her bosom sleep. His wretched plight allayed her fears, She kissed and bathed him with her tears. The merry eyes began to glow, The rosy hand essayed the bow, The rough disguise was cast aside. And laughing, Love for mercy cried. Love came a beggar to her gate, More wisely than with pomp and state. For who hath woman’s pity won May count love’s siege and battle won, FORGET ME NOT. Forget me not though to thy heart’s desire, Some livelier flame awaken in thy soul, Bidding all thoughts of other days retire. Before the.radiance of a happier goal. Yours not the guilt that sent my inmost woe My dreary, sad, irrevocable lot And in the distance it were sweet to know That you forget me not. Forget me not if in thy heart are cares, (Yet surely thou art far too fair for grief) If unshed tears give sudden vent to prayers In which the careworn soul must find relief.

Did She Want to Ridm.— lt was an omnibus. A woman was running after it with frantic haste, jumping up and down at every step, waving her parasol in the air, and shrieking ""Stop !

A Cuke for Laziness.— The following singular treatment was formerly applied in Dutch workhouses to indolent ami. apathetic individuals: — The patient was placed in a sort of large tub, into which water was kept constantly flowing through a pipe, so that in order to keep himself from drowning he had to turn a crank which pumped the water out again. The water supply aad the hours of working were nicely adjusted to his strength and endurance, and the amount gradually increased every day.

""If you know what it is all about ; it it seems to be saying, 1, 2, 3, hop, hop, hop, or 1, 2, 3, bang, bang, bang, you may conclude at once that you are listening to something of a very low order, which it is your duty to despise. But when you hear Bome thing that sounds as if an assorted lot of notes had been put into a barrel and were being pre sently stirred up, like a kind of harmonious gruel, you may know it's a fugue, and assume an expression of protound interest. If the notes appear to have been dropped by acci dent, and are being fished up by irregular intervals in a sort of placid or drowned con dition, it is likely to be a nocturne, and noc turnes, you know, are quite too utterly lovely for anything. If the notes seem to come in carloads, each of a different kind from the first, and if the train seems to be an unreason ably long time in passing a given point, it will turn out, most likely, to be a symphony, and symphonies are just the grandest things that ever were. If the notes appear to be lumped out in masses and then blown wildly into the air by explosions of dynamite, that is rhap sody, and rhapsodies are among the latest things iv music."" — Bohemian. The Major-General and the Captain. It is said that the Major-General in charge of the militia here, after reading the iuterview which a reporter had with the Captain of the Salvation Army, concluded that he ought to show him some military courtesies, and so in vited him to dinner. "" Hallelujah ! How d'ye do ?"" said the visitor, on entering a fashionable restaurant, in response to the in vitation, and as he looked around and saw nothing but cold water on the table he smiled approvingly. "" And you drink water, too, General T' said the Salvationist. "" Most fre quently,"" was the reply. "" Here's to your health, brother soldier !"" And the mundane and spiritual officers pledged each other. The first course was terrapin soup, with about a bottle of good old Madeira in it. It was a new dish to the Salvationist, and he brightened up considerably after the third plateful, and asked all about the habits of terrapin. "" Hal lelujah ! But it's comforting and warming."" ""Only a very plain repast,"" replied the M.G., as the waiter brought on a roast hare with cur rant jelly and burgundy sauce. ""Delicious eating, a hare .'"" said the Captain, "" and mag nificent sauce this. We poor soldiers of the church seldom fare like this. Gimme some more Bauce. And what exquisite coffoe !"" he continued, as he swallowed a cup of black coffee with a glass of cognac in it, and passed it to the waiter to refill it. ""So proud to meet a man like you, General, in this city. Such noble example ! Going to write to head quarters tonight. Splendid omelette that, I too — looks as if it had been on fire."" "" Try a preserved peach,"" said the General, helping I his guest liberally to some brandied peaches — they're very soothing— and jußt one more cup of coffee, before you go."" "" Hallelujah ! General, don't care if I do. Shay, Genrul, donsyherfeel shleepy ?"" And the good man bowed his head on the table aud was dreaming in three minutes that he was leading a crusade in Chicago and had converted 14,000 gamblers. When he woke up he did not feel well, and his host was facing him blowing a fragrant Havana. "" Accept my carriage home, Cap tain,"" he said, as ha led him into a four- bit coupe"" and told the diiver where to take them. The Captain did not preach that night, aud he has been wondering ever since whether there was not something queer about that coffoe. The Bad Boy and the Prize Packages. "" Well, well,"" remarked the grocery man as the boy came into the store and sat up on the edge of the counter, ""you loom up well fora boy with the ague. I thought you couldn't get. out of bed; you haven't been around for a week."" - ""Oh, the ague's played out. I guess they run out of quinine m this town while I was sick. Anyhow they fired nearly a barrel of it down my neck,"" replied the boy, helping him self to an apple. "" I heard your father was arrested last Saturday. What's the trouble?"" asked tho grocery man, as he closed a new gate he had made at the end of the counter to keep the boy away from the sugar. "" Well, he did come near being run in, sure, and I guess he would if it hadn't been for me. You see, ma has been sick ever since she went into the deacon's cellar to draw cider and met that skunk, so she told pa if he would get a couple of good fat hens she would try and make a pot pie for Sunday, as she folt her health failing, and if her appetite didn't improve soon she would go hence, whatever she mean*. So that evening pa started out after hens. He was too late to get dressed ones, so he got two live ones from the market and started home. Me and my chum were layin' for him, and when he got about half way home it commenced to rain and he started on a run so as to not get wet. We followed and met a policeman and told him wo saw a man steal two hens, and pointed out l'ia as the man. The policeman started after him and yelled at him to halt, but pa did not hear him. Pretty soon pa saw that some one was chasing him and thought it was robbers, so he ran all tho harder. Then the policeman pulled out hi? revolver and fired into the air to scare pa, ju^t as one of the hens got her wings lopse and flopped it in pa's eye. Pa dropped i with a groan, and said : ' I'm shot. Tell my wife I died happy,' Then a crowd got around him, but when pa found he wasn't dead he called for a stretcher to be carried home to die with his family. While some of the crowd went for the stretcher the rest began to examine him to see where the bullet went in, and when they couldn't find it, he got up and offered to liak any man who said he wasn't shot. Just then another policeman came up and said he recognised him as ' Chicago Bill,' a notorious safe robber, and that a reward was offered for him. Pa said he was an honest man and agreed to go back to the market with the chickens and be identified. They found only one of the chickens, but the market man knew pa and fixed it, and then the policeman began to beg pa's pardon and gave him five dollars to keep still about it. When pa got home he told ma he had helped to catch a safe-blower, and when he got his share of the reward she could have a new sealskin sacque."" ""Your father'll kill you some day. But what about the fuss at the social at the deacon's night before last?"" asked the grocery man, as he picked the flyspecks off from a lot of maple sugar he was putting away for ""new maple sugar"" next spring. ""I heard the whole church was mad at e>ach other over a grab-bag, and the presiding elder had all he could do to quiet things down. "" That don't amount to much,"" replied the boy. ""There's always something turns up when the sociable season first starts in. You sac, ma has appointsd a committee to fix upa grab bag. Me and my chum were digging bait that morning to go fishing, when pa came out and said, "" Hennery, I believe you put up that chicken job on ma, and I don't bolievo anything but hard work will reform you, I want you to spado up the ground under tho currant bushes.' I asked him if ho wanted a hump-backed, disfigured boy, made so by hard work. Pa said he would rials the huitfp, and told We <fo pitch in, and then went down town. My chum said he would help me, and me and him got the job done before 2 o'clock. When we got done I come in and found ma bad finished the grab bag, and had it all loaded, With the top fastened with a puckering string and hung on the back of a chair. Ma was upstairß getting her Sunday clothes on, to go to the sociable, so it didn't take me and my chum long to empty the bag and get first choice. Then I got our mouse trap and took it to the barn, and caught two nice big fat mice and put 'em in a collar-box with holes cut in it to give 'em air, and dropped 'era in the bag. Then my chum remembered a big snapping turtle he had in the swill barrel, and me and him got that and wiped it as dry as we could, and tied it all up but its head and put that in just as the deacon's hired man came to take the bag over to the sociable, and then me and my chum went over and got up in a tree where we could see through the open window and hear -all that was going on. Pa he stood over by the bag and shouted, "" Ten cents a grab ; don't let anybody be backward in a good cause.' Three or four had put up their ten cents and made a grab when an old maid from Oshkosh, who had been to the springs for hysterics, got in her work on the collar-box. When she got the cover off, one of the mice, that knew his busi ness, jumped on her shoulder and crawled down her neck, and the other dropped down on the floor and started round to meet the other one. You'd a died to seen her hop and show her stockings and scream. The deacon's folks thought it was another attack of hys terics, and pa and the deacon got her on the aofa and held her while they poured paregoric and cayenne pepper down her. When she got 003e sha screamed all the harder. Then one of the other women seen the mouse and got up in a chair and shook her skirts and asked the new young minister to help her catch the mouse. The poor fellow looked as though he would like to, but be failed. Just then the bottom of the chair broke and let her fall over on ma and tore her bangs all down. Ma called her a ' hateful thing ' and told her she ought to be ashamed of herself. Finally they got things in order, but no one wanted to tackle the bag, and as here was where the profits came in, pa braced up and said he'd like to know why everybody acted so 'spicious. He'd like to see a grab-bag that would give him the hysterics, and said * women are always gettin' scared at nothin'.' He then put down 10 cents and jammed his hand way down in the bottom of the bag, but he didn't keep it there long. He gave a jump and yanked his hand out yellin' ' thunder !' Then he swung it over his head to shake it off, and brought it down on the deacon's bead, and smashed his specs. Then he swung it the other way, and struck the woman president of the sewing society in the stomach and knocked her down in the dea con's lap. After pa had hollered himself hoarse, the turtle let go, and pa said he ' could lick the man that put that steel-trap in the grab-bag.' Then pa and ma got mad, and everybody began to jaw, and they all went home. There's been a sort of coldness among the members ever since. I guess he won't have a hump backed boy, but I'll get even with him, you just see if I don't."" And the boy went out and took a sign, ""Warranted Fresh,"" from the fruit stand, and hung it on a blind horse that was hitched up to a garbage waggon ie front of the store.",Fiction

Glad as he was to at last see a possible client sitting in his office, it added to the-interost that she was young and beautiful, and while he remained silent, lost in wonderiug admi ration, she rose to her feet, moved a few steps nearer to him, and gazed at him long and earnestly.

TO THE EDITOR.,"Sin,,— l see by my last week* Witness that the W,\nUhain Farmers' Club coußider the Rabbit Act in adequate to cope with the pe^t, and that they have reioivod to appeal to their fellow farmurs throughout the land to submit to taxation - nay, to beg to geo themselves taxed, and to pray that th« working ot the Act might be ve-ted in ttie various couaty councils. Surely the Wjndha'ii district mi;st be in a bad way witu tbo nuisanco, or olte the Farmerb' Club would nover come to conclusions which are simply tanta mount t ) a vote of censure and want of confidence in all the Governme-it inspectors. Now this is too sweeping. lhou,'h 1 admit there are come duffers in their ranks, yet there are a great many intelligent and efflcienti officers to be met with among the rabbit in bueators of Ut»go and Southland. But it jist acryes the inspectors right ; for had i.hey imparti»lly carried ' out the Act with that firmness and wisdom which doubtless) their chief expected of them, irre9ptctive of party infl l ences or persons, the farmers would not now want to supersede them. Public ofßctrs Bho'ild always btar in mi^d that it is tetter to be dreaded than despised ; but Ish iuld like to know what betti r the couutry would be had the county councils tho power to appoint iivptc ors. Would not the same backstairs infl lenca be brought to boar upon them that has been done iv tho ense of the present staff? Certainly th<y woudadvertiseforeißeieritanaoxperiei)ced.rnen; bull h:\vo _ not been 10 \ ear* in Australasia without knowing what a county cjuncil advertisement moan-, especially when there is a luciative ""berth, with all the hard work taken ous of it, concerned. Would not tbe fnemliy ex-storekeeper who had proved hircibelt a failure, or the genteel loafer who had never done a d.iy'a hard work in his life, but who might happen to bo somehow connected wi h a councillor,— would not such men as theso ba appointed as tho ntw rabbit insp *ctora, to the exclusion of experience and merit ? I, who hat c trapped oa tho Yellowstone and hunted on the Ganges— ai.d there are scores of other men to bo had in New Zialand equ.lly as well poßted as regards bunny and » is natural enemies as I am,— l airk whai bhow would 1 or an.v other Btrangor have of obtaining: Mich a poht merely backed up by experience aud meiit '! Why, none whatever. And now, Sir, about tun taxation tint the Wvndham Farmers' Club aie so anxious to get themselves yoked to. Porinit me to inform thorn that I consider the rabbit nuid&nco a national misfortune; and as the whjle lslaud is biund to suffer if they are not mastered and kept down— for they are buro to spread to the remotest par<> thereof,— in like manner the whole couuiry would more or less participate in tne tide of prosperity which would bo wire 10 flow in the wake of their destruction. I therefore consider that all j ejipouecs eomieutdd with the woiking of the Act — and J It la the best Act that has ever been placed on the Htatute-book fir tho purpose— should be borne by the country at large. Besides, in some respects the pro po ed : tax would become unduly heavy and unfair. For iiibtance, the New Zealand Agricultural Com pany speut tnomunds of pou ,di a'crling iv poisoning their estate with pho.-phorisod gia'n last winter, aud since tuen they ha\e had a Urge staff <f men on at wo'.-kly wages trapping 1 , shoot.ug, fumigating, aud digging ous, and this ib not an isolated case. Theie areoihcr runholders who have done in like manner according to their holding. ;. ow pray, in tho name of justice, is it faif, whou wi. b-ar their present enor mous expenses in mind, to tax buch men as tiiosn Or whit beuifio could i hey derive from the tax? I' wonder th*t tno Wyndhaui farmers' Club, ere ttiey came to the above resolution, did not summon the local inspectoia to their nu^ust presence - seeing that the itspeiitird neglected to summon than, and inform them in measured terms whaS they thought of their cinduut, and that failing in futuie to put the Act in full force the farmer* would report them at head quarter?. That iudeed wo Id have been a step in the right direction, and 1 intend to adopt such a course in,Y*e!f before 1 ing. I have been informed on good Hutboriti that to put the Act in force there is room for about a hundred rabbiiers in the Gore and Mataura districts. Tie ctuncos are I may be my own master in a few da>s>' Mine, and as I have a young horse that wan'B riding preitj badly I shall visit cho-e districts, aud should thoso reports prove true, upon my word Mr Bftj ley bha'l know all about it, for it id ab nit time that o. ergeiie sttpj were Ukeu to wipe out the \ e->t ; and if there is not uuited and simultaneous action taken by all concerned, that can never be. I sep by the Witness that one of tho -consequences of using bi-ulphide of carbon is iusauity to the opsrator. vl courao under theso circumstances for tho Bake of humanity we shall lave to givoit up, for t should rather meet a thousand rabbits any day than one mad rabbiter, particularly if he should have » breech-loader in hia company. Thank goodness we have a grand and a cheaper substitute for it in the ferret, for the tame ferret is invaluible in the breed ing ssagon, especially among rocks and huge sandy burrows, where the carbon would not act. Many a line piddock of wheat, oats, aud turnips which has been trampled and destroyed by rabbits would have been saved by 25a worth of f errets—l— l mean a pair • for by working tdem once a week oa all the burrows connected with the paddock, the progeny would have been destroyed as soon as they were born, and by getting come yatds of small fishing net and-cutting into lengths of about 3}ffc, and spreading each length over a hole ere the ferret was let in, the caances are that 75 per cent, of the large rabbits would aUo have been destroyed. Ferrets are also very useful in keep ing cornstacks clear of rats, for they destroy their young eagerly, and tho old iats can be destroyed at the same time should thero be a few good terriers present. J was among tho first who described and advocated the importation of tho mongoose and I am happy to see in the Witness that they are giving such satisfaction in New South Wales. They would oe valuable in our bush reserves. They gonerally hunt in pairs on the trail, and they are so re-iolute that they never give up the chase till they brintr their quarry to bay. They will not live on our bleak, cold mountains, but for grass paddocks and homesteads the ferret is far superior.

Next day Miles and his son walked out through the grounds of seven Oaks, and after a long stroll came to the high bank overlooking the brook that separated the Castleton and Marston properties. They were standing amid thick brushwood look ing at the, stream, which, rushing here oyer its rocky bed, broke into white, miniature falls along the whole' width of its course, when their attention was caught by the flicker of a white dress on the further bank, and before they had time to halloa a warn ing, Sylvia was boldly picking her way across the stream, setting her feet upon the stepping-stones with the utmost nicety and precision. , Miles Castleton watched, her crossing the stream with a look of greater interest and admiration than he had yet been known to assume. Herbert, is she not?"" said he, as the girl lightly leaped from the last stone to the bank. "" She is handsome indeed."" "" Take her round to the house, Herbert ; I shall be there presently, but meantime,: I must see Marston for a few minutes."" With these words, Miles walked up the stream to the rustic bridge, and crossed; while Herbert, jubilant because of this op portunity, the first he had had, of speaking to. Sylvia alone, walked rapidly down -fche bank to meet his betrothed. Last night the lovers were constrained. Herbert's father knew nothing of the en gagement, and the two young people, pining to exchange only half a dozen words with each other, were kept asunder as effectually by this consideration as by a wall of iron. But now there were ho bonds to restrain them. When they met there was a quick em brace, a clasping of hands, a rush of hur ried question and answer. And then, as they turned to ascend the bank, there was again an interchange of vows, such as had been spoken under the lindens at Steinbad. Afterwards, with perfect trust in each other, and thrilling to the brave and noble love which ruled the hearts of both, they walked more soberly along to Seven Oaks. They approached the house from the side where stood the conservatory, and, as they knew Miles could not yet have returned from his visit to Sir Scrymgeour, they en tered, and, standing surrounded by ascreen of leaves and blossoms, they talked over their plans and prospects. Swiftly the minutes glided past as they talked fondly ofthe scenes and incidents of their early love ; of the happy time at Stein bad ; of the long weary days of separation ; of the happiness of their reunion ; of their chances of securing the good-will of the. master of Seven Oaks. ""Sylvia, dear,"" said Herbert, bending over the girl, whose fresh bright face and luxuriant brown hair seemed to him more lovely now than ever — "" Sylvia, you have done marvels. You have assuredly won my father's good-will."" "" I never really tried to please him, Her bert ; for I liked him from the first — liked him for his courtesy and kindness, which suggested to me, somehow, the chivalric politeness of our grandfathers."" ""I shall speak to him to-day. lam almost sure we will win him over ; but if not, dearest, we must fight fortune for our selves."" "" With you, Herbert, I am ready to ac cept whatever may happen."" At this point of the dialogue thfire was, perhaps, no special occesion for an embrace and a kiss ; but between lovers such things are said to take place without much pro vocation. Herbert folded her gently in his arms and kissed her, while she looked up to him with glowing cheeks, and eyes spark ling with pleasure. A moment after, a crash was heard, and the glass door of the conservatory, burst open by a powerful blow, was dashed to atoms against the flower stands. Sylvia screamed and clung to Herbert, who, turn ing round, saw his father standing in the doorway, and Sir Scrymgeour, pale and terror-stricken, waiting close behind. The most horrid sight that Herbert had ever seen met his gaze when he turned. His father stood there with all the rage of all the Castletons in his face. His hands were clenched, and every limb in his body was trembling with passion. His face and lips were grey — colourless; and his features seemed to be stamped out in iron. ""What means this?"" thundered Miles Castleton, as he glared upon his son. "" It means that Sylvia and I have been in love with each other for a year."" "" What ! and her father knew it ?"" "" Yes ; and you, too, should have known of our engagement to-day."" ""Miserable, detestable poltroon and swindler 1"" cried Miles, as he turned to the baronet. ""You knew of this, yet you brought your daughter daily across my path. You knew it when to-day I asked you to let her be my wife, and obtained your con sent. When you borrowed my money — robbed me of it — you believed that a mar riage settlement would clear scores between us. You taught your wily, smiling daugh ter, too, to conspire with you. Dotard, your scheme has failed! As for you, sir, you mean to marry her and Btarve her. Success to you in your plan ! Never seek to see my face again ! Out of my house, all of you! Curse you all! I "" But at this instant, stepping backward with limbs tottering under his paroxysm of passion, his heel caught the corner of the entrance, and he swung back in a moment and fell heavily, his head striking with a dull-sounding shock upon the marble balus trade that lined the doorway. With a cry, Herbert sprang to his father, who lay on the ground before him insensi ble, and with a great gash on the back of his head, from which the blood already flowed freely. ""Sylvia,"" cried Herbert, ""can I depend upon you ? Are you able to assist me ?'"" ""Quite able now, Herbert,"" answered the girl, from whom all the faintness she had felt during the last few minutes, had already passed away. They knelt down by the corpse-like figure, and while Sylvia raised the head, Herbert hurriedly bound it with his hand kerchief. ""I shall call the servants, Sylvia. Tell them what to do as well as you can. Let him be carried in. I myself will ride to Winthorpe for the doctor."" With these words, rapidly and trem- I blingly spoken, the young man ran to the | house, rang the bell violently, called out ""^■-\YAAr' ■■■■■'•' ""-■■:-■-;s***:■'■■ ■ ■■■■■-■ ■ ' the servants, and hurrying to the stable, he was soon, with the assistance of the groom, mounted on the strongest of the saddle < horses. A few minutes saw him in full gallop on the high road to Winthorpe, a considerable village at the distance Of about five miles. : Meanwhile Sylvia, calm, self-possessed, thoughtful— WhUe her father, pale, crouch ing, bewildered, tottered about crushing his 1 hands the oho within the other — directed the servants in what was most needful to do. Miles Castleton was carried within, and laid upon his own bed. The doctor, on his arrival, examined and dressed the wound, which he pronounced most serious. ""If we can only prevent fever,"" he said, ""we may yet pull him through."" The parting that night between Herbert and Sylvia, though sad, was more tender than their meeting in the morning. They had now drunk of the bitter-sweet of life. Sylvia's father oould never again be to her all that he had been before. She knew this as she lay that night upon her bed, and sobbing until the early morning. But Herbert was nearer and dearer to her now than ever, and she felt that he and she were separated from the world now to live for each other till the end, whatever might betide. All the evening, and deep into the night, Miles Castleton lay insensible and silent as a stone. Looking at the white turban-like bandage that was folded round his head, at his bronzed complexion, at the long, sweep ing moustache, and the closely-shaven chin, one could have imagined that this was some Indian rajah who had been slain in war. A little after midnight, Herbert and the doctor slipped into the room softly to look at the patient, and inquire of the nurse how he was going on. No change had yet taken place ; but as they stood there gazing towards the couch, the sufferer heaved a long, low sigh, and soon after that began to utter sounds that seemed to be compounded of moans and of vain efforts at articulation, so unlike were they to the accents familiar .'fn English ears. .;""' i. * e .__te""is now sensible of the pain,"" whis pered the doctor, ""and these sounds are : only tokens of his suffering."" Herbert listened intently for a minute ; .then a new light suddenly flashed upon him. ; no!"" he said, ""not that. He is speaking Hindustani."" Here, then, was a new difficulty. The poor sufferer might be murmuring his wants in the language which he had used longer than English,, and no one could understand him. ""Gordon!"" exclaimed Herbert, and softly and quickly withdrew from the room, leaving the doctor in amazement afi his mysterious exclamation. Herbert now wrote a note to Mr. Gordon, his father's solicitor, and the only man in England who knew anything ofthe sufferer's affairs, as he had been acquainted with him in early days. This much Herbert knew ; but he was not aware that Gordon had been one of his father's most intimate friends and had acted as groomsman at Miles's marriage to Ellen Travers, in Calcutta, thirty years ago. Mr. Gordon was dressing, when a series of resounding raps was heard at the street door, and a minute afterwards his servant came up with Herbert's note, and intimated that .an answer was expected. A very grave expression passed over his face as he read the few words. ""Tell the messenger,"" said he, ""thati shall be at Seven Oaks in three hours from this . time. In the meantime call a Hansom."" When the cab made its appearance, Gordon snatched up his hat, gloves, and stick, and getting in, told the man to drive as smartly as possible to Mr. Robert Gor don's office, Number — , Chancery Lane. When he arrived, he got out, opened the door of his office, walked in, and selected from about a hundred brown tin boxes one upon which the name "" Miles Castleton "" was printed in large yellow letters. This box he opened and examined, and seeming satisfied with the examination, he relocked it, and pocketing the key and again fastening the door, he brought out the box and de posited it in the Hansom. ""Drive hard to London Bridge,"" was the next order, and away he rattled at a great pace down the Lane, Fleet-street, up swarming Ludgate Hill, round Saint Paul's, and along Cannon-street to the busy bridge from which you can go right away to any part of the world. Gordon's journey was not a distant, one. He booked for Win thorpe, from which station he procured a trap, and was rapidly driven over to Seven Oaks, where he arrived about an hour be fore mid-day. When he entered, and was ushered into the parlour, the stillness of the house, and the voices whispering low, sent a chill to . the worthy solicitor's heart, and he began to fear the worst. "" How is he, Herbert ?"" he asked. <? No better — worse, we think. The . fever,, that we did all we could to keep hack, has seized him, and he has been „ raving ever since the early morning. Oh, , ; Gordon, it is dreadful to hear him ! In his -ravings, he speaks mostly in Hindustani, and as none of us can tell the meaning of . anything he says, it seems to me somehow as if he was dying alone."" t . ""Be calm, Herbert, boy. I know the . language, and can well enough understand him. Let us go up now together quietly."" ' - .- . They were going out from the sitting room into the hall, when Sylvia Marston, who had just come in, approached. ""No better, Sylvia — worse, I am afraid,"" said Herbert, in answer to her inquiries. • ""We are now going up to see' him; will you come ?"" t - ., She hesitated one moment, then answered decisively, "" Yes, Herbert, I will."" ; •  They went up together to the bed-room. V; Herbert ahd Gordon stood at the side of the bed, and Sylvia crouched down on a low J; ! stool at its foot.

The slaves must have trembled when they Ijeard him as be speaks now, for he does not spare them. Now, now; Herbert, he is talking to your mother about you."" Miles continued to toss uneasily upon his bed, always speaking as he turned from one side to the other, Then for a time he lay quiet, and the watchers were about to return below, when suddenly he raised himself, and looking out as into the far distance, with eyes of unfathomable longing, heoried with a wailing, heartrending voice, "" Oh, mera Hamam, mera Hamam, come back from the woods to me, come back from the woods to mcl"" "" For heaven's sake, what is this, Gor don ?"" asked Herbert eagerly. ""He was calling for your mother, Her bert,"" said he— -""your mother, who has been dead these twenty years.

Ten years after they were married, he took her with him up to his tea plantation on the hills. One day he leffc her, to go a day's journey on busi ness. When he came back, Hamam was gone. The few servants who had been left with her in the factory knew nothing of her. disappearance — at least, they said so. No trace was ever found of her, save a few torn shreds of the dress she was known to have worn. These were found in the wood that stretched up the hill from your father's plantation, and some of them were stained with blood. This is all that is known."" But if the raving planter's cry had awakened tragic memories in the mind of the lawyer, it cast balm on another heart that had been deeply wounded. To Sylvia Marston, crouching at the bed-foot, the story of Miles Castleton's loyal devotion to his wife— his love that was stronger than death — came with all sweet consolation. She knew now that Miles's heart was still true to her who was the joy of his youth. She knew that if he lived it would not pain him to know that she was Herbert's. For days the fits of raving continued, decreasing, however, in violence and fre quency. One morning, very early, Herbert went into the bedroom with some medicine. The nurse, worn out with fatigue, was sound asleep. He walked to the middle of the room before he turned to his father ; but when he did turn, his heart bounded within him, and a suppressed cry burst from his lips. One glance at thafc face was enough. Miles Castleton was dead ! Steady enough was the gaze, indeed ; it was fixed ever lastingly. Little more' need be added. On the day of the funeral, Gordon, in the presence of the executors — most of them bankers in London— produced the brown box which he had brought with him from Chancery Lane, and therefrom drew out the will of the deceased gentleman. This document assigned all his property to his only son, Herbert, with the exception of certain sums to be used for specific purposes, a few lega cies, and a very handsome douceur to Mr. Gordon himself — a favor which met with lively appreciation from the praiseworthy Scot. Seven Oaks was long shut up, its owner spending his time, for the most part, on the Continent, in the company of a tall, elderly gentleman and a very beautiful young lady. After being closed for about a year, the old house was re-opened, and Herbert and his wife Sylvia came home to it, to find a final refuge under the old roof-tree.

HEW HOREOLK. —LEGEND OE “ HELL’S GATE.” There are two routes to New Norfolk, either of whicli will furnish matter of interest, and afford delightful peeps of rural grandeur and beauty to the tourist. The overland one leads, or, in the olden days, used to lead through a charming country up the valley of the Derwent, bounded on each side by a background of high bills which were all densely wooded. Pretty farm homesteads were pleasantly situated here and there, and substantial dwellings nestling among gardens and orchards, with outlying clumps of bush beyond them, and hedges of wild rose fenced off from the road fields that were waving with com or fragrant with new mown hay—the whole scenery closely resembled that of some of the southern English counties. The water-route up the Derwent was a very pleasant one in fine weather, and opened up to the traveller some pretty views of cultivated country, with occasional glimpses of the wild fantastic ruggedness of nature in the lowering rocks and jut ting knolls which flank the river, and in the faces of cliffs that were tapestried with foliage, and furrowed with tiny cascades. Villages have been gradually formed with the gathering population on the river banks, and many of the early settlers in the neighbourhood of New Norfolk had given considerable attention to the cultivation of bops, which had be come an amply remunerative industry in the district. These outlying centres of settlement were accessible from Hobart Town by steamboat and by coach com munication. Edward and his friend went overland in order to make their fust stage at an early hour, and have some time to look about them before starling for the Lodge. In those days New Norfolk was a straggling village, covering some extent of ground. It could not boast of many fine bull lings ; but ther'e was one public institution which, however plain and unadorned exteriorly, was yet of great practical utility to the community. It was the Library and Reading Room, which was well furnished with books and with newspapers and periodicals of vari ous kinds. The young men having secured apartments at the Bush inn called on Dr H , who received them with all the hospitality characteristic of the educated class in Tasmania. After an early tea they stripped a gigantic cherry tree of all the fruit within their reach, and then strolled out in company with the young ladies and Capt. Gr , who was over on furlough from China where his regiment was then stationed. Seating themselves on a grassy knoll which commanded an extensive view of the country around, they pointed out to Oliver some features of the landscape of peculiar and memorable interest. “Ton see that bend in the river,” cried Edward, pointing in the direction of the Derwent, “ with the great dismal looking rocky bank frowning upon the eddying stream ?” “ Yes,” was the reply. “ It is known by the name of Hell’s G-at«.” “ How does it come about,” asked Oliver, “ that we find so manv names iu this southern part of the Island of a Scriptural or Eastern origin ?” “ ‘ Thereby hangs a tale,’ ” Edward replied. “ The picturesque grouping of Palestinian and Syrian names in the neighbourhood of this place and Hobart Town has prompted more than one to ask that question. It does strike a stranger as something odd, to say the least of it, to be asked, ‘Are you going to Jericho, sir?’ or to hear a man say, ‘ I’ve just got back from the Jordan, and am now on my way to Bagdad’; and when one is dilating upon the enchanting scenery and splendid shooting he had found, and you ask in a quiver of excitement, ‘ Where ?’ it is rather bewildering to get the reply, ‘ In Abyssinia, sir.’ Well, the story runs thus: In the very early days of the settlement here great difficulty was ex perienced respecting the supply of anim.il food for the colonists, and parties were sent out into the bush to hunt for kan garoos, emus, and other game. One of these parties consisted of a marine named (Jermaine and two convicts. On the spot occupied ny Hobart Town bar racks, Germaine killed a monster kan garoo, nine feet in length, whose hind quarters, it is said, weighed one hundred and thirty-two pounds. They were fond of the sport and enjoyed a roving life, and took to bush ranging as a regular occupation. For five years they carried on that hazardous work, and during all that time they never had the luxury of a bed to sleep in. Only one of them could read, and the only books ;n their posses sion were a Bible and “ The Arabian Nights Entertainments.” Whenever, therefore, they were in want of a name to distinguish a place, after they hauated their very limited stock of Kan garoo Point and Emu Plain, they took a name out of one or other of the books in their possession. That is the popular way of explaining the thing; but whether there is any historical truth in it I’m not in a position to say.” “ But did you ever know how it was that the name Hell’s Gate came to be imposed on that romantic bend of the river ?” asked a young lady of the party who was on a visit from the city to the Doctor’s family. “No,” said Edward, “do let us hear it. It is pretty well spiced, I suspect, with love and murder, for it is positively astounding to note the interest which these things have for men and—ladies. How often in human life we come upon sudden transitions from pathos to bathos, and I should think that a likely enough place to quench the fires of unrequited love.” He spoke in an overpoweringly dolorous and lugubrious tone, looking wistfully all the while in the direction of the swirling rive' 1 , and the Captain lifted fer a moment his great sad eyes to the speaker’s,.face, and then sprang from his seat on the sward, and patting him gently on the shoulder, said “Don’t; There’s a good fellow! Don’t; it’ll all come right.” There’s just as good fish in the sea -As ever jet was taken ; Come ! spread your nets once more and try, And you’ll soon get one, I reckon. The Captain’s sally was received with shouts of laughter by the company, and as soon as Edward could be beard, he cried, “ ’Tis a misquotation and I must V “ Only a warrantable variation,” broke in the Captain, “to suit the circum stances of the case,” and he resumed his seat. “ Now, then, for the story,” cried some of the ladies. “But I will tell it only on the one condition,” she said, looking archly over at Ned, “that the person who shill in any way or upon any pretext interrupt me shall forfeit one shilling to be ex pended on- stakes for the game of ‘ spin.’ ” That was unanimously agreed to and she proceeded as follows, “An old coach man who was with us for many years told me when I was a little girl the story of the origin of the name. Of course I ‘can’t vouch for its truth, but here it is as I got it. Many years ago, in the early days of the c dony, a family lived over there about a mile back from the river, in an old mansion house which has long been consumed by fire. There was an only daughter, a beautiful blonde, pos sessed of all the higher accomplishments whhh lend a charm and grace to the sex. The fame other vocal powers spread far and wide,; and her favorite instrument was the harp whose strings her fingers swept with magical effect on the hearts of men. She used to frequent a little bower which her father had constructed in the garden in close proximity to the house, and there she sat in the gloaming either striking the harp-strings, or warbl ing some ditty while occupied with deli cate finger work. Her bower faced the Dromedary, that great mountain over yonder, whose summit she used to watch with unwearying interest as it glowed with the changing tints reflected upon it by the setting srn. On one occasion a young officer was riding past on some official errand, ana he stood spell-bound under the witchery of the music that was wafted towards him sn the breeze. His horze restively champed the bit and pawed the ground, but still he lingered on, Ills eyes fixed in the direction of the bower long after the sounds had died away. A foot passenger on the road looked up in his face with some surprise, and respect fully touching his cap, was passing on when the horseman asked, ‘ Who lives over there ?’ * Mr Lingard,’ was the reply. ‘ And can you teU roe who the lair singer is whose voice I heard just now?’ ‘ His daughter’s,’ said the man, and with a dark expression of countenance that deepened into something like ferocity lie abruptly turned away. “ You may well enough suppose,” said the fair narrator, “ that tbe officer speedily got an introduction to the family whom he frequently visited, and paid marked attention to the lady whose grace and beauty had fairly ravished bis heart. He won her love, the bridal day was fixed and preparations for the happy event moved on, as they always do, with eager step. One evening when the lady and her lover were in the garden, seated to gether on a large rustic chair, their atten tion was aroused by a rustling in the bushes close at hand, and a sound re sembling a stifled sob. j ‘ What can it be ?’ asked Miss Lingard , in some alarm. ) ‘lt is nothing,’her companion rejoined, ‘ don’t alarm yourself,’ but seeing sbe j was somewhat disturbed he led her away towards the house. “As they passed up one of the walks they caught sight of a man upon whose pale face was a scowl of hate and de fiance turned towards the officer.” ‘jWho is that man,’ he asked, ‘ I’ve seen him somewhere before and with someth ing of that same look upon his face.’ ‘ Yes,’ he continued after a pause, ‘ the very first night I heard your voice pour ing its wealth of melody into the air, that fellow passed by me and I put some ques tion to him regarding yourself. Who is he?’ *He is one of my father’s convict labourers,’ was the reply. “He has often crossed my path of late and I have a sort of shuddering dread of him.’ ‘ It was only a day or two afterwards that Miss Lingard went out on foot to visit a neighbor, and returning early in the afternoon by an unfrequented path way through the bush, she encountered a man who stepped in front of her from behind an old blackwood tree. She saw at a glance it was the convict, and he had a hard despairing sort of look on his face which made her uneasy. Her first im pulse was to scream but she checked it, for, she thought, first, It won’t be of any use, and second, It will look undignified “ Bravo ! Miss]Lingard,” cried Edward. “Her cool composure of mind in the cir cumstances is worthy of all admiration.” “ The penalty of interruption sir, is one shilling for stakes for ‘spin.’ Captain! will you be good enough to enforce the fine !” “ Double it,” cried the young ladies, “for such a grossly aggravated interrup tion, just at the point when the interest was so paramount and absorbing.” “ Agreed,” they all cried. “Here you are, captain,” said Ned, handing him the appointed penalty, “ but remember I enter my solemn protest against the horrriblc imposition.” “ Well, the ruffian fell upon his knees and confessed his love to her in the ordinary frienzied and disjointed way in wh : ch speeches are made on such 'occa sions, and when she scornfully waved him away out of her path, he seized her hand and pressed it to his lips, bearing fur ther violence she called aloud for help, and before her cowardly assailant had become aware of bis presence, the officer bad sprung upon him and dashed him with violence to the ground. The con vict leaping to his feet drew a revolver and fired, but before be could discharge a second barrel the weapon was wrenched from his grasp and be sought safety in flight. But Mr Lingard who was coming* up heard the shot, and seeing the fugi tive, gave chase, and when they emerged from the shelter of the bush he raised a hue and cry which brought some neigh bouring settlers to his help. The pursuit grew hot and keen as they neared the river, and with a desperate leap from the rock the hunted man plunged into the eddying stream, and never more was seen of mortal eye. The spot in which he sank came to he called by the name which it now bears.” Other explanations of the name are given,” said Edward, but we’ll agree to accept yours as much the most interest ing and pathetic of them all; aud it is quite satisfactory to kuow that iu the popular opinion at least the villain was righteously relegated to his own place. But finish your story, pray. ""Was the young man wounded, aud did he die and leave the lady a pray to wasting grief ?” “No he didn’t die, at least not then, but recovered through skilled and tender nursing, and married, and, as the novels say, lived happily all the rest of bis life.” Of course the whole party then went borne, some of them musing sentimen tally on the great mystery of human love, aud they spent an hour in the highly intellectual and edifying game of ‘spun’ In the opening years of this century Norfolk Island was made a penal settle ment by the British G-ovcrnment for the worst class of criminals sent out to New South Wales, and Dr H. had been trans ferred to that island. But the experi ment was unsuccessful, and the estab lishment was broken up in the year 1855, when the Doctor was removed to New Norfolk, where he has an established reputation for shrewd intelligence and gen.i-il kindness aud a large-hearted hos pitality.

I got a whiff of smoke from the cigar he was puffing. The aroma was delightful, and the impression that it made upon me was that Culbertson was a man of educated and somewhat extravagant tastes, though not of sufficient means always to gratify them. I became interested in him,a,ndmy interest was repaid not only by the discovery that my first impression was correct, but that his was a most unique character. In due time we became quite intimate, and the intimacy, while increasing my interest, at the same time fillel me with a sincere re gard for the young fellow. Commercially, I found him to be in a moderately prosperous business ; morally, I found him to be a modern Joseph— staunch in his virtue, though beset on all hands by temptation, before which a less sturdy character must have fallen prone. He was a puzzle to me, which at times I gave up all hope o? solving. Now gay, frivolous, light-hearted, he would suddenly become sober, solemn, and morose, and the metamorphosis was nearly always without apparent reason. All efforts to draw from him the cause were gently but firmly re pulsed. On other occasions he would leave me suddenly, and dart oft almost without a word, to be gone sometimes two or three days. I remember an instance last summer, while we were spending a fortnight at Long Branch. We were seated together on the piazza of the West End. The morning was hot and stifling. The wind had been from off shore for several days, and the sun had shrivelled the flowers in the beds on the hotel lawns, and so baked the drives as to keep the watering carts incessantly busy laying the dust. Suddenly Culbertson looked up from his paper. •' Bead 1 "" he exclaimed, ""it is the 10th of August, isn't it ? I had almost forgotten."" Then he disappeared into the house, and half an hour after I saw him jump into the coach that was about starting for the train bound New Yorkward. Two days later I picked up a copy of the World, and read in the news from Bar Harbour : "" Mr John Lawrence Culbertson, of Phila delphia, is stopping at Roddick's."" On August 14th he was back at the Branch. ""How did you enjoy your Bar Harbour excursion 1 "" I asked. He looked hurt by the question, but did not seem surprised. ""It was on business, not pleasure, that I went,"" he answered curtly, and he was gloomy for two days afterward. During the recent American opera season in Philadelphia, I met him in the lobby during the last act of "" Les Huguenots."" ""I am tired of it,"" he said. "" Let us stroll up to the Bellevue and have some terrapin and champagne."" There was not a vacant place in the cafe, so we went into the ladies' supper room. We had not been seated long before an elderly gentleman, a distinguished-looking man, with white beard and moustache, of military cut, followed by a young woman, whose beauty attracted me on the instant, came in, and took seats at a table just opposite us. The woman was quite fair, and her figure, which was well displayed by a costume of most admirable fit, was simply ravishing in its plump roundness. When at length I turned my admiring gaae from her back to Culbertson, I found an una>ecountable change had come over him. He was frowning ominously. His cheeks were flushed, and his teeth had left their marks in his lower lip. "" I say, old man,"" I exclaimed in surprise, "" what's come "" over you ? You look as mad as a hatter."" j\fy friend made no reply for an instant, but flecked a crumb from the tablecloth with his napkin. Then he poured some wine into a glass and drank it off thirstily. •' Not now,"" he answered at length, "" not now. Later I may tell you all."" Several times I noted that he cast rapid glances at the woman I had noticed, and I also observed that she occasionally looked furtively at him. . 41 Can it be that they are acquainted 7 I asked myself, and after due consideiation I put away such an idea as too improbable to build upon, CulbertsoK was unusually quiet throughout our stay at the Bellevue, and not until he had lighted a cigar and we were well out on the street did he volunteer $> remark. > ""Did you see the fair woman }n the beaded opera cloak, with white feather tr£n> raing!"" he asked at length, taking long pulls at his cigar between jev-ery other word.. •• Yes,"" I replied, "" I saw there was a per son of that description in thefoogt."" ""Do you know who #ho is?"" be &»&<* again. I confessed that I did not. ""She is my wifej"" The words fell upon my hearing like a thunderbolt. Up to that moment, well as I knew Cuibertson, I never suspected that he was^mairied, or had ever had a romance. "" Was your wife, you mean \ "" I suggested, when 1 had recovered from the staggering blow he had dealt me. "" You are divorced ? "" ""Divorced!"" he said somewhat fiercely. "" No, sir; lam not divorced. I pray heaven I never shall be. It is not because that old man— devil that he is— has not worked hard to accomplish it, but he has failed, failed signally at every point, and his daughter is still my wife."" Again he was silent for a while. His feelings had evidently got the better of him for the moment, and he would not trust him self to go on. * It was in quite a retired nook of the Social Art Club that he told me his story at last, when the evening was wearing apace, and when the noisy boys who frequent the place in the wee sma' hours before dawn had de parted. He had come to Philadelphia when 18 years old, he said — he is now 23— and had secured a place at a small salary in Camp bell's paper warehouse. Mr Campbell had been a friend of his father's, and was very kind to him. He was a poor youth, and his weekly stipend being scarcely sufficient to pay his board and clothe him, Mr Campbell generously offered him a home in his own stately west-end mansion. Mr Campbell's daughter, Clarice, was just DUdding into womanhood then, and young Culbertson would have been less than flesh and blood had he not fallen in love with her. He did fall, he told me— fell madly, passion ately, absorbingly in love. Clarice filled his every thought, made him unfit for business, and fired his passion to a pitch that was maddening. The usual result followed. They were secretly married, and when Mr Campbell found it out Culbertson was igno miniously dismissed from the Campbell home, and deposed from his position in the paper warehouse. "" Then,"" he said, to use his own words, ""I fell into luck. An old college chum turned up, who befriended me. He gave me a lift, and 1 was soon in a way to make a respect able income, but old Campbell would not relent. I had deceived him, he said, and under no circumstances should I have the wife I had won. As for her, her paternal love was great— she adored her father. She was his only child. Mrs Campbell had died years before, and, much as I pleaded with her, she would not leave him. Her father's word was law, and what he bade her do was with her second nature. Then the old man tried to secure a divorce for his daughter, but I got down to his methods, and I have outwitted him. ""What I tell you now will explain, I imagine, many things which Lave puzzled you. In the first place, he thought to force me into making application for a separation. Clarice was very gay for a while. She flirted with men of acknowledged loose reputation — men whose breath was pollution, whose company was equal to social ostracism. I watched her carefully. I found she took no pleasure in her folly. She was acting under orders ; and I knew she would go so far and no further. I declined to seek a divorce. Then I found that ray footsteps were being dogged. They have been dogged from that day to this by paid detectives, in the hope that I should fall into the snares of fair women that have been laid for me. Thank God, I have avoided all such pitfalls."" ""But the desertion plea,"" I suggested. "" Surely that is open to them now ? "" "" No,"" he answereed, "" you are wrong. I have made it a point to visit the Campbells regularly. On the twelfth day of each month I call upon my wife, present my card, and beg an audience. I am invariably re fused."" "" But she could surely secure a divorce on the ground of non-support?"" I ventured again. "" Even that loophole is closed to her, or rather to him,"" Culbertson answered, as he knocked the ashes from his cigar. ""Every month, wilh the regularity of clock-work,! send to my wife a cheque for lOOdol, and it is just as regularly returned to me. My dear friend, I have made this matter a study, and the sharpest lawyers in Philadelphia have been unable to outwit me. By no possible technicality can these bonds be broken. Campbell will die some day, and' the moment his breath leaves his body Clarice will send for me.

Donald, dost thou mind that twilight, Now so many years ago, When my heart first thrilled to music Of your voice so sweet and low ? How you shaped, in. words, the blessings Lave, to wedded souls, would bring ; While you sealed the vows you made With this dear betrothal ring ? Donald, dost thou mind the altar Where we stood on that glad day When my father blessed and kissed me, Ere he gave the bride away ? Ail life’s skies seemed fair and golden, All life’s ways seemed bright with flowers, While our wedding-bells kept chiming Through those consecrated hours.

You will keep beside me, Donald, Though my failing eyes grow dim, Though my dull ears miss the echo Of life’s tender vesper-hymn; I shall feel the kindly pressure, If you lay your hand on mine— Hand.so true and heart so faithful, Though love cbass so poor a shrine.

She received many offers ; but she had no thought of marking till Lord Strange asked her. I didn't believe she'd take him, but she did, though it oouldn't have been for anything but his title and money, for though not so much older than she, he was very ill-favoured, his face all scarred up with a burn he had got when a child, and he had as cross and jealous a temper as ever I saw. Besides that, one shoulder was higher than the other, and he had a withered limb, which made him drag one foot when he walked, so he wasn't graceful, let alone being handsome. He was desperately fond of my lady. He was that jealous of her he could not bear her t3 look at another man ; and to do her justice, she humoured him wonder fully in this respect. I don't believe any lady could have been more careful than she was in not doing anything to vex him. One day, when my lord called at the house to see my mistress about some old family jewels he was having re-set for her, there was a stranger with him, a dark, handsome, foreign - looking gentleman, who looked at my mistress a great deal, and could not conceal how much he was struck with her beauty. I wondered at so jealous a man as Lord Strange bringing this handsome gentle man to see his promised wife, but I wondered still more at the way he looked at those two, and then he kept asking questions and looking at my mistress as he answered them, for all the world as if he were trying to catch her in a trap. But that night my mistress told me the handsome stranger was only a new secret ary my lord had got, and I concluded I had been fanciful in my imaginings. But the next day Lord Strange came again, and brought the handsoma secret ary with him, this time into my mistress s own boudoir. She must have been sur prised, but she never sho wed it. She had learned already that my lord liked her to take everything he did as a matter of oourse. The secretary's name was Vassilis, I found, and I took the opportunity to bo iu the next room, the door of which openel from the boudoir, and I kept in ajar enough to watch what went on. I wanted to satisfy myself,yousee,about that secretary. He stared at my mistress worse than the day before, aud my lord watched him and her in the same queer way, Lord Strauge wa6 not at all like himself—one miuute too gay for him, the next gloomy aud scowling. He couldn't sit still even, but must go limping about the room and gnawing his finger nails as iio watched my mistress tideway.-. ' There is mischief br >wiug somehow,' I said to myself. You see, m) - mistress teemed so perfectly unconscious, either of my lord's strauge manner, or Mr. Vassilis's absurd be haviour. But he wasn't to blame. My mistress was so handsome it was no wonder he stared—and he a Frenchman, too. I don'i suppose he ever saw so beautiful a creature in his life before as my mistress was. She was so used at being stared at, I don't suppose she knew any thing about it half the time. I had been with my mistress a long while, and she knew I was devoted to her. Sometimes she would talk quite josy-like with me. Well, that night, when I was dressing her hair, she asked me if I ever noticed anything 6trange about my lord ; and I said ' Yes, I have noticed it.' She turned right round and looked at me. ' What have you seen, Ancette '? ' said she. ' I think he's crazy with jealousy,' said I ; ' and that's what is the matter with him.' My mistress turned white as a sheet. ' Oh ! ' said she, ' I never thought of thai. I believe you are right, Annette. He does act like a person not in his right mind.' ' Oh ! I don't mean that exactly,' sai 11. ' I know what you mean,' my mistress said ; but I dou,t think she did. The next morning, as she stood at her dressing-room window, she called to me, in impatience aud dismay ' Annette, here is Lord Strange and that Mr. Vassilis again. I suppose we are to have the same thing over again as yester day. I want you to go down to the conservatory, and stay there near the drawing-room door all the time. Watcli Lord Strange particularly, and tell me just how he looks and acts, ' I will,' I said ; and I went down to the conservatory at once and hid behind some of the big plants, and my mistress came and looked at me and nodded and smiled ; but I noticed she was very pale. She scarcely looked at my lord and Mr. Vassilis when they came in, though she greeted both courteously enough in words. My lord sat down a moment and then muttered something, got up and went ont of the room abruptly. My mistress looked after him with anxious eyes. 4 He's going somewhere to watch those two,' I thought; and sure enough, in a minute I heard his dragging steps comins; behind me, and dodged just back in time, though 1 don't think he would have known I was there if he had seen me, he was looking so intently into the drawing-room. I looked too, and I saw my mistress, who had scarcely noticed the secretary before, leave her ohair now and go near to him, speaking earnestly ; and the French fellow must need lay his hands on his heart as he answered her, and look as excited as if it was something of importance. I thought for a moment my lord would leap in at them and tear the man in pieces. His eyes glared like a wild beast's and I could hear his teeth grind upon each other. ' It is true, then,' he muttered, savagely ; 1 she does love that handsome scoundrel. Oh ! but it shall cost him dear., He stood there some moments longer. But my mistress bad gone back to her ohair, and presently my lord retraced his steps, and I saw him after a little enter the drawing-room by the same door he had gone out at. He was smiling in such a dreadful kind of way, that it scared me even at that distance to see. I wondered how my mistress could meet it calmly. The two gentlemen went away, and my mistress called me to come to her. I took one step, caught my foot somehow, I don't know on what to this day, and fell sprawling. That was the last I knew for weeks. I struck my head on a flower-pot as I fell. You can see the scar yet. I came near dying, they said. Well, almost the first thing I heard when I got to know anything again, was that Lord Strange had been robbed of twenty thousand pounds' worth of the family jewels, and that ho had accused Mr. Vassilis, his secretary, of taking them. Mr. Vassilis was in prison, and was to be tried at the next assizes, whioh were almost at hand. It was my mistress who told me thifl, and she looked troubled and anxious. She was to bo married in a few weeks, and the preparations for the wedding were going on as fast as possible ; but she seemed worried and out of spirits for one so soon to be a bride. 4 Did you watch Lord Strange that day, as I told you, Annette ? ' she asked me, 4 or have you forgotten all about it ? ' No, I had not forgotten. Everything came back to me as she spoke. I told her all about my lord coming into the conser vatory, and what he muttered to himself as he stood there. My mistress looked startled, but she could not understand it more than I ; nor go much, for I did have my suspicions even then, though I did not dare tell them. 4 It is impossible that he could have been really jealous of Mr. Vassilis, she said, 4 his own secretary. Why, I never saw the man in my life till Lord Strange brought him here, and I never spoke a word to him that Lord Strange did not hear till that day, and then I only asked him if he thought Lord Strange was quite well. I began to think the man was crazy himself wheu he put his hand upon his heart in that absurd manner, and looked so excited.' My mistress was married at the appoint ed time, aud Lord Strange took her away on the wedding tour. I was not sufficiently recovered to go with them, but I met them in London on their return, and went down to Castle Strange with them. Mr. Vassilis had been tried metuwhile, found guilty, and sentenced t > transportation. He hung himself to the cell the day after sentence was passed—made a rope out of the sheets of 'lis bed to do it with. I heard at tho castle some particulars of the robbery. Tin jewels which were missing ha 1 been in town some time to bo re set f<>r my mistress. The day they were Ptolen Lor.i Strange had gone to the ! jewellers shop who had them, and after ex'iminiug the work so far as it was com pleted, had found all mannor of fault with it, and ended by ordering every one to be immo liately packed again iu tho box he ha 1 brought the jewels there iu, and taken oi>t to his carriage. He left the establish ment in ouo of t!i.) well-kuown tempers. His secretary was with him. They entered liis lordship's ctrriage, aud put the box of jewels on tho scat between them. Lord Strange's own coachm m was on the box. They rode ten miles out of his lordship's suburban viila. From the park gates to the house it was about thirly minutes' drive by a winding road. Woeu tho carriage reached the homo there was no driver on the box, though thero had been at tho gates. Both Lird Strange and his secretary were inside in a deep drugged sleep. Tle box of jewels .vas gone. They found the driver in an insensible condition back almost to tho gates. He had not t>eeu drilled. He had beor. knocked off the b>>x by a heavy blow from behind, a blow with a club, whicn had only missed killing him. Lord Strange was the first to come to himself after some hours. The last thing he remembered was drinking with Mr. Vassilis some wine, which must have been drugged. But by whom '? Who besides themselves and tho jeweller could have known they had the jewels with them ? An accident, as it seamed at the time, revealed the fact that Mr. Vaasilis had a bottle of morphine in his pocket. Tho secretary was still sleeping. Either he had takeu more than Lord Strauge of the drugged wine, or had taken it later. Lord Strauge at ouce boldly accused the uuoonscioiH secretary of having first drugged him, probably before they eutered the gates, then climbed oit and knocked the driver senseless on the way to the house, after war is concealing the jewels or pass : ug them to a confederate, and finally drugging himself to divert suspicion. The finding of the bottle of morphine on Vassilis was what condemned him. The unfor tunate man denied having ever seen it before tho moment it was shown to him, and when told what he was accused of, between horror and weakness fainted, and lay unconscious for hours, in spite of every efforts of the physician in attendance to restore him. All this time Lord Strange limped back and fortli, not far away, his ugly face diato'ted with rage and threatening, a frightful sight to see. The footman whose place it was to be in attendance ou my lord that day, but who had been left in London on what he him self considered a pretence, told me that tie heard my lord matter more than once iu the days that followed, with the secretary raving in deliriun : ' I don't want him to die, curse him ! I want him disgraced, turned black with infamy, and sent to rot in a felon's cell.' I sai 1 I had had my suspicions. Now, when I heard all these thing, they grew stronger than erer. But I never dared utter them. I believed that, whoever else had got the jewels, poor young V&ssilis did not take them. But I did not dare say so. I used to wonder sometimes if Lord Strange, or my mistress, ever thought of him They were neither of them happy though my lord had got the woman he loved, and my mistress had got the titles and riches she coveted. The two never quarrelled. Bad-tem pered as he was, my lord never showed his temper to oy mistress. But everyone could see that they were neither of them happy. One day, when we had been at Castle Strange some weeks, feasting and making pretence of being merry, the house full of company, my mistress asked her husbaud to show her the muniment room. This was the strong room of the castle. When my lord consented, instead of taking any of her guests with her, she oalled me t> atteud her. Sue would never be alone with her husban.l, if she oould help it. My mistress examined all the curious treasures of the muniment room eagerly, and myl ord, pleased at her intrest, showed her how to open the most secret repositories there, and displayed their costly oontents. I don't know how it could have happened ; my lord must have made the blunder him self, and opened a door he never would have had my mistress see beyond, in hie deliberate senses. I heard a sort of soream from my mistress suddenly. She was bending over a long ebony box which was open, and Lard Strange stood by, with such a face as I hope never to again. Livid with despair and horror, distorted with an expression more evil than I would have believed possible to a human countenance, he stood watohing his wife. My mistress raised her head an I looked at him. The truth had oome to her at at last. ' These are the jewels you acoused that man Vassilis of stealing !' she said, in a voice so changed I should never have known it as hers. ' Yes,' my lord answered, an awful blaze in his eyes, 4 they are. The only crime that poor wretch was guilty of Wis being loved by you.' 4 Liar ! ' was all she said. ' Lord Strange took a letter out of the box, and gave it to her in silence. I knew afterwards what it contained. It was an amonyous letter, accusing cy mistress of having known and loved Vassilis abroad. It must have been written in the merest malice by someone who envied I*:>rd Strange for having won her, and who, knowing how jealous he was, played upon that woakuess. My mistross read the letter through to the end before she looked up. Then she said, in the same terrible, ohanged voice : ' My lord, I never saw Mr. Vassilis but three times in my life, aud then you were with him. I nevsr spoke to Mr. Vassilis in my life till you brought him yourself into my presence' My lord wis a pitiable sight. He seemed to shrink and shrivel up under her looks and words, as though actual flames had touched him. Suddenly he fell upon his knees, and crawled in the dirt at ber feet. 'Oh ! forgive me.' he m jaued. 'lt was my mad love for you made me do it.' My mistress looked down at him with a sort of shudder, as if he had been some poisonous a ;d loathsome reptile. ' I will never forgive you,' she said slowly. ' I will never s.eak to you again if I can help it.' She took my arm and went away and left him. As wo passed out of the door I looked back. 4 Oh ! my lady,' I said, 1 thero is blood. He is dead, I am sure.' Even then sho would not go back to him. But she let me go. He is dead. He had burst a blood-vessel in his of remorse, shame, aud despair. My mistress has never married again. Wny should she '? S'la is rich enough. Lml Strange settled a fortune on her when they were married, and she has her title. She is Lady Strange. Besides, she detests tue very na'.ue of love or marriage.",Fiction

Theo turned towards me as we reached the stepping-stones ' I will not take you any f trther, Mr. St m lev. Thmk you for coming «o far.' [glancsd round at the mists and at the low sun. We had been longer thin I thought. ' Let me come with jon as far as Craig Coch ? The dusk falls so quickly.' ' No,' she sail, smiling, and holding out her hand for Hie little bag I whs currying; *it can't be four yet ; and I shall be up the wood paths in no time ' —pointing at the terraced woods on the opposite side— and, when I get to to top, I always take a run along that 1 >vely mossy turf, stnight down to G>eh.

Well, good-byi l , then, since it mu»t bi so ; and, d>ar —remember! ' She was stin ling, as I have said, up jii the first otepphg-ston<\ her hind still in mine. As I spok* she suddenly bent, with a light qutc'< movement, towards me. Her eyes looked gravely inti mine. It *ai as though I had never before realised their full splen dour. A steadfast lijht was shining i"" their wonderful depths. It wis the look of one that would die for another. ' I promise,' she said. And then something hippmed—how, I ould never quite remember or tell. It was but the touch of soft lipj upon my li lid. But the tonc'i of thi angel Ithuriel's sp>ar in E lon never produced mora s'riking resuUs. The iis3 of friendihip gave wiy in a moment to a far mightier power —the power of love—for good or for evil the love of my li f e. My heart, beit s> wildly I rould nor spbak. Asu Idon thrill of delight lifted me lutfh ab»ve all considerations, present or future Sjl'-ontrol the self-eontrol on which I pride I myself— »hore was it ? Gbne. In the sudden impulsj of the raimmt I place! my arm nun I Thoo's slen ler waist and drew her biok s ronglj, determine lly towards me. I meant to return that kiss. She should hear all I was longing to tell her—n)»— it onee ! But she resisted with all her power; her face was bent down, crimsm with shame. She trbd with all her strength to push my arm away, and her resistance brought mo to my s j n=es. Hal I mistaken gratitude for love? Very likely. Even if I had not, how ungentlemanly—nay, unman'y—my conduct must appear. As these thoughts dished through my mind I slowly unloosed my arm from her waist.. 'Theo, my darling, forgive me ? ' I whis pered j and, swift as a bird from an unclosed hand, she sped from stepping-ston * to step ping-stone ; and, Wore my heart oeased from its quick, irregular beating, had disappeared up the rocky zig-zag pith. I s'ood there chilled, dismayed, in the first glory of my new-found happiness. If that li'tle stream that divided us had been the narrow one of death, I could scarcely have se. n my darling go with a sadder, more despairing feeling. For a minute or two I stood watching the spot that seemed so empty and desolatp now she had disappeared, then I turned homeward. Whit if she had gone away in anger P What an utter fool T had been to behave as I hai behaved—l> frighten my s »oet little friend in her trusting impulsive gratitude— only gratitude. And perhaps she would never forgive rne ? Fet I could pcircely think that; my darling was too sweot-niturel. Then that look upon her face. No; though she might be righteously angry, she could never have changed so soon and so completely to one at whom she had looked like that. And, wi'lnhe sudden reaction that often follows so quickly upon depre«sion, when one's feelings arc much excited, mv spirits rose as quickly almost as they had f»U*n. Yes, before that time the next day I should have toH lrr all. And tl'O answer would be favourable. She would forgive rov sudden madness, and, though T had never spoken to her of love, she would reo gnise that it had been 1 >ve with rne all along—even though I had not known it mysol', and the sulden knowledge had so deprived me of all self-control. I quickened my steps as T though* this, as though by so doing I eould hapten the time that lav be ween me and the hour that was to be the crowning-point in ray life. When I reached Pengarth the **hite mom light lay full upon evr'ry'hin.', except, where checker >d by trees and rooks an I broken hy the shadow of tho old gray house that stood squar."" and black up n iho lawn. In the hall I m>t Travers ' Here yd are at Ins', Stanley ! 1 say, th it '' vww "" mus r have been seductive, judging fr >m the time you've boon.

' Hope thy may continue to understand each ot er ' I rem irked ra'her vaguely. The fact was, I »ih dehatmg whether I should speak to fruv ra upG't the subject that had t»V""o sole po-=se9*'on of my mini. But no —I decided not to do so. From her lips alone must I firrt he>r what was to decide the happines* or miso-y of my life. Chaptrk YI I awoke the next morning to look upon a"" beau'if til a day as I ever remembered to have and I haled the hippy omen. The soft yet bright sunlight one sometime* sees in November rested upon everything. The uncertainty of mv new happiness made me restless. How s'.ould I fill u;> the time untd the -sfternoon, when f intended to take my gun an 1 stroll in the direction of Craig Coch ? My heart beat more quickly at the thought. Travers was going to the nearest town upon business af'or breikhst, and askad me to acco npauy him. But I declined, remarking tha' I should like a walk with my gun ti see what I ro'.ld pick up, and would take a biscuit and some sandwiches if ho would excuse my nppearance at luncheon. Trovers looked a' me with an amused smile a* I s'rugglcd through my explanation. ' Oh, never mind me, old fellow ! ' he laujhe 1 ' This is liberty hall, you know. I may w I may not be in to luncheon, and Pen z miy °"" may not tu r n up—he's alwavs un cert .in But I say, Stanley, if it were any o-ie b .t you who showed this sudilen inclina tion for solitude I should suspect a love affiir' About half an hour Inter Travers waved his har.d to me in farewell as he rode down the winding drive, and I ws at liberty to pursue mv own devices. How the morning passed I could scarcely siy, but I diil not make mt:ch havoc mnong the Pengirth preserves. I mis<ed a fine cook pheasant that rose like a rocket in front of me, and white-tailed rahbi's scudded across my pa'h unmolested. At length, however, the long morning came to an end, and consulting my wa f ch for about the twentieth time, I found it wanted just five minutes t> two. She would not be re turning yet; still it w>uld b.i as well to turn my steps towards Craig Coch. I consult *d my wa'ch again as I entered the little gl> n aid strolled si >wly towards the stepping-tones that crossed the stream. 0 ily a quirter-pist two! Really I f.anciel old Time had determined to stand still that day out of sheer spite. Well, I must make the best of it, and be as patient ss I could man* age t > be. 8c thinking, I stepped across the stones and climbed up the tide of the woo led bank to wait. It was of no us> going o i to Craig Coch by the zig-zags yet. Underneath a tree a boulder covered with thick moss nffordod a fairly comfortable seat. I took a cigar from the poeket of my sho iting- j ickeN lightod it and beg>n to snoke My gun I place 1 carefully against the tree The oigar was soothing, my train of thought delightful—th a re was nothing to 'isturb it upon this lonely hill side. Thi ripple of the stream below, a rustle in the withered fern as a solitay nut dropped over-ripe from its shrivelled shell, wero the onlv sounds I heard ; the j e, and a faint deep sound from the direc tion of Pengarth, that, owing to the great stillness of the air, had once or twice mixed with, scarcely broken into, my reverie. Then earn? another B>und, which broke suddenly and harshly upon the stillness—the clatter of a blue-winded jty I pitched a fir cone at him a* he sat in a tree opposite, eyeing me with an uncanny appearance of under standing mo and my business far better than I approved. But the interruption had broken my train of thought. The air must libto been remark ably still, for that echo ng sound from the Pengarth direction seemed much nearer as I leaned back once more upon my boulder. Then I rose iiidden'y irto an upright position again, and listened There coul ibe no doubt about it—the sound was not at Pengirth—it was moving onward—it was coming in my direction. In another moment I was upon my feet, looking across the stream ut, the opposite wooded hill Then the sound broke out clearly, and quite nßar-just on the other side of the wo id oppisito-it was the bay of the bloodhound Cuba. I stood still, watching the wood, feeling annoyed and dnturbed. So I remained for about two minutes, and then I caught sight of the bloodhound's great black-and- an body as he broke through the cover, and, slipping through withered bracken and undergrowth, oame—nose to the ground —rapidly down to the glen below. He was following the very path Theo and I had taken the day before. 1 had no time far any conjecture. Almost immediately following Cuba came the sound of many footsteps. A number of men were pressing down after bim. A murmur of voices, not loud, but eager, came to my ears across the glen. I counted the men as they scrambled down the rocky paths, now lost for a moment behind boulders or undergrowth, and then eoming quickly into view again as they eagerly fol lowed on after Cub i, 'keeping him well withiu sight. One two. three—actually seven or eight men! A n d in front of them all T recog nised the spare active figure of Ephraitn Q-reon, the Yankee. What could they be doing—surely they were not oimin* mv way ? The idea dismayed and annoyed me. That upon this day of all days that stupid old Yankee should hring the bloodhound there for training, or runninj. or whatever he might pleas* to call the absorbing occupation. Tho man must be an idiot. Did he know, or had he forgotten, that Miss Travers would return tint way to-diy? It, would terrify her if there should ho any chance encounter. Thoroughly rouse! T hastened down ray side of the hill, as quickly n* they wore scrambling down the other. Cuba had nearly reached the bottom, when I attrkCed Kph raim's attention by a shout. His answer cam* clearly enough. ' Stand back, misler !' What the old rascal meant I could not then understand. I took no notice, but simply increased my pace. I was determined to inter cept their further progress at, tho steppi»g stones. They would cross there Cuba was already in the glen, he was run ning rapidly towards tho stones, when Eph raim's voice aeain rang out— 'Stand back, I say! By the livin' jingo he'll pull you down !' T stopped back half involuntarily. My gun T had left again t tho tree, I hud not even a stick to defend myself with. But, Ephraim's word* routed my temper. ' You cannot enne across,' I called impera tively to Ephraim ; ' aro you awu.ro that, Miss Travers is returning from Cwm this way P ' Cuba was running up and down opposite to the stepping-stones, sniffin? tho ground, but not attempting to cos*. Now and then his voice echoed ominously through the glen. At my question Ephraim and tho men with him came to a s'undstil!—i group of pale grave faces—an Ino one answered for some time. At last Ephraim sr>ok>>. ' Whar hev you bin, mister ? They're rousin' ereaMon yonder ' —jerking his thumb in the dir?ction of Pongarth. 'Charles Travers is ridin' lo the end of every whar. No one know* what's gone o' missie—she's never bin to C*m ! ' The words, ''ailing clearly upon my ears, stunnei me. Through the sudden chaos of doubt, fear, suspicion, one terrible idei suing me. Treachery—the treachery of a boautiful woman. No ne* thing—ilas! Still this would be deceit, passing the deceit of woman. I thought no more of Cuba but with a hound or two the stepping-stones. At the same time Cub\ dished ranidly across, half by the stepp : ng-9'ones, half through tho stream. A shower ef cold wa r * r (lew into my fare and over me as ho stood and shook him self for no instate. Rut he took no notice of me His bloodshot eyes were fixed upon the ground as ho sn ffed his way hither and thither, running in narrowing circles. Tho next moment I was surrounded hy a group of pale excited faces, as the men follow ing him—never troubling themselves about stepping-stone*— dashed any way and every wav across tbe stream. Then my voice retur ed to me—a strained hoa'se voice I should never have recognised as mv own. ' You are never tracking her—Miss Travers —with the bloodhouni ? ' And Epbraim replied ' I thought o' Cuba, mister—no one else. He'll track her if she's on <ho yearth beneath —as far as she's bin —or *o the water under the ye tr*h if she's in thar. Thar's no livin' creetur can follow trail through water that I've Vard !' ' Goo I heavens ! What do you think ? Wh t does her father think ? ' 'Thar's no timo for thinkin', mister, it's finlin' we've got to do.' Ephraim closed his lips tightly, turned abruptly, and hast med after Cuba, who was running—though slowly—towards the zig zags. And, after a few d uibtful glances, the men lef' me and followed him—ail but Hugh Roland, the game-keeper—little Divie's father. With tho quick perception of a Welshman he saw that I hid received a blow, and with a Welshman's quic'< sympathy he lingered a moment to speak a word of explanation and comfort. Coming nearer to me, he said in a low voic'*— ' The master thinks ur young lady has run away with tha"" voung Mr. Pander—he his been ah >ut harelh.'se two or thrre days. But indeed our dear lady woul 1 not do such a thine ! ' I put out my hand and clasped his. He may Have wondered at my so thanking him for his kind judgment but I scarcely knew I had done it myself until I met tho grate sympathy in his eyes. Then we both turned, and without further words hastened up tho zig-zigs after Ephraim and the others. We overtook them before they had gono very far. I hastened on and j lined Ephraim in tho front He acknowledged my presence with a slight nod, never taking ''ii eyes off the hound, to whom now and he spoke quick en oourayjing words. Cuba »m running slowly ; at times lie senne I at fault. N<> doubt the leaves lying here and there along tho narrow pith confused him, though the sharp breezes of a week or so ago, blowing this way from the sea, had swept the greater quantity into oornera and crevices und carriol them higher up tho rocky banks. We pressed on silently. As for me, I r elt like a man in tin wi!d changes of some fever dream. What reasonable explanation could bo given of Theo's disippearanco ? Treachery alone could eiplain i* ; mil yot—oh, what a mockery of the joy I had been feeling a f.w short minutes ago—that I shou'd he following a bloodhound upon her truck ! We pressed on, still o \ up the zig-zags. We were coming near to i placo I knew— where the great mass of gray rock seemed to hang over and bl ck the pathway. There, round the rock, I ha I first seen Th>'o. As we upproiched it more nearly a wild thrill of hope, suddenly within me, seemed to promise that there I mii>lv see her a^sin — see her histeuing down the steop pith with the lipht etep [-knew so well—coming to explain everything and dissipate the cloud of a-nietv and fear thi' wis upon u* all, nnd oh, how darkly upon me! Looking onwar.l, it seemed to nn that I saw a gleam of whit"" among the brown leafl«ss tre's. In the impulse of the moment I la'd my hand heivily upon Ephraiin's shoulder. His eyes fo lowed mine, then turned qii'ckly upon my face. A smile, half stern, half pity ing, curved his lipi for u moment; then he huiried on eagerly as before ; and as we came nearer to the rock I siw on'y the trunk of the silvery birch gleaming white and wan against a background of gray rock and brown trees, the slender bra r ches stripped of leaves, sway ing and shivering to every breath of air. Still I kept close to Cuba as we passed under the shadow of the rock and round to the other side. No one was there. The path wound upward to the next turn, desolate, empty—empty with a terrible emptiness j ani in my hearttrose a bitter roioeless cry— (To be continued.)",Fiction

B. Ferguson. As I recom mended the purchase by Mr A. M'Farlaneof the said heifer, and was present when tho transaction was completed, I am in a position to explain the terms of purchase. I accompanied Mr A. M'Farlane to Mr Eankin's, where he bought a few Ayrshire cattle. Running amongst them at the time waa a small yearling .heifer of Mr M'llwrick's, which I noticed, having bred her bite and dam. On leaving for town Mr Rankin accompanied us to the gate, where it so happened we met Mr M'll wrick, and as Mr Rankin and myself had advised Mr M'Farlane to buy the heifer, he a9ked Mr M'llwrick what price ,he wanted for the yearling heifer from Mr Warnoek's cow, that was running amongst Mr Rank'n's cattle (the one that had been under offer to Mr K. B. Ferguson). The price wbb named, and Mr M'Farlane replied: ""I will ta l e her ai the money, and you cau s6iid her up along with those I have bought from Mr Bankiu ; and then call on Messrs Wilson, Tame, aud Co., luvercnrgHl, and lh>y will give you a cheque for the amount."" 3 lid heifrr was sold as a yearling, and was Btxtall at that age. She was more lfko a 10 - month - old heifer thau over it. No precise age or date of calving was mentioned at the time further than that 6be was called a year ling, and she would have been considered weedy so far as «ize was concerned in a year ling class of Ayrshires in a show ring. As it so happened I was .at last Dunedin show, and I heard a lot of disturbance about the heifer through Mr K. B. Ferguson, and to satisfy myself aud others I requested Mr John Douglass, V.S., to come, and we examined her mouth, and after we had done so I maintained that, according to all recognistd rules of shedding teeth, she wa9 only two years old, and Mr John Douglass stated at the time that no veterinary surgeon could contradict me in my opinion. When leaving for home Mr A. M'Farlane requested me as a favour to see Mr M'llwrick, and get the exact date of her age from him in writing. When 1 mentioned the matter to Mr M'llwriek the first tirao I met him, be was nob sure of her age, but he said, "" I will see Mr Raskin about it,"" and that he would know the date she was calved «n. Sometime afterwards he sent me one date by post, and I afterwards met him in town, and he gave me another date, both of which are in Meagre MFarlane'e possession. As a matter of fair play I tbiuk it right that this should be mace public through the press, by doing bo you will oblige.— Yours, &c., David Wabnocx, Broomlands, Invercar&Hl. October 21.

Sir, —It would be very useful, as well as Interesting, if (Erestedian, or some one else great at figures, would make the calculation, at the present rate of the increase of rabbits, how long it would take to stock the whole of New Zealand. I have no talent in this direc tion, f>Qt have put it down as a rough guess at 20 years. I am inclined to think a much shorter time would suffice to make this island untenable to any other herbivorous quadruped. It would, I think, be very interesting to Darwin or some other naturalist to watch the gradual disappearance of several other races of powerful animals before this apparently harmless and innoceut creature. It might furnish a clue to unravelling the mystery of how a great number of other races of animals have disappeared, and are now only known bv their fossil remains, such as the moa, droma therinian silvestre, the mammoth Megathe rium mastodon, &c. These thoughts were suggested by a conversation I had the other day with a highly intelligent runholder on the East Coast. In conversation with this person' I said, "" Have you got the rabbits over your way yet;"" he answered, "" Yes, they are just beginning to spread, and I believe they will drive Us all out of the country yet."" I smiled at this, when he said, "" Well, I can assure you that up above Masterton they are so bad that a number of people are thinking of leaving their farms to the rabbits, and all of them would sell out for a mere trifle if they could get an offer; and I know that two young men who have a run on the Rangitumau have actually left it to the rabbits, after being at the expense of fencing, building a house, and planting a garden, &c.""

The following conversation took place between employer ""ana employee -.—Mr W.~-Well, Mr P., do you see much difference in the appear ance of the lack run now to what it was thrtd years since. Mr P.—Yes, sir, there is as much difference now to what it was three yesrs since as there is between that croquet lawn and that gravel-path. Three years since there were hundreds of wild cattle on the back run fit for the butcher, now there is not a blade of grass to be seen, Mr W.—lndeed is it so bad. In three days after this Mr W. had quietly disposed of his run to another. Some time after this I saw a drove of cattle and also a drove of hones that came from this neighborhood, and on asking the driver where they came from, he said "" Oh, they have been running with the rabbits, and any one could see by their gothic architecture, which had had the best of it. No* one of the horses or cattle would have lived through the winter.

Sib, —I would like to draw public atten tion through your columns to the bad state of the ventilation of the Saxon mine. Through this the whole of the fibuters are being greatly hampered in their work. The other day I read a letter in your paper in which the writer justly complains about the dilatoriness of our Mining In spector, and the (act that he is shutting; his eyes to the locking up of the Queen of Peauty mine, whereas if it was some poor devil without any influence he would not mind pouncing upon him. I suppose he will let this ground be locked up for another sor 6 years. But this is beside the point, and not what I now want to call attention to. My grievance is that Mr Wilson does not periodically inspect the mines and see to the saf- ty of the workmen. If he had oi>l? taken the trouble within the last week or two to wa!k from his office to the Saxon mine—a few hundred yards - he would have found the ventilation so very bad as to claim his attention. I be'ieve that the manager (Mr Crawford) wishes to do his best to let the men work, but if what I bear is correct, the directors don't want him to incur any expense. Just fancy ! Over 20 tributers are work ing in the mine (no wages men at all', and yet the company won't spend a £5 note and improve the ventilation to enable them to woik. This is niggardly with a vengeance.

Ifc was a Peace Commissioner, And his garb was sober drab ; His hair was long and white, and he Economized his gab. In short, he was a reticent And inoffensive slab. His style was philanthropic, And he bore a carpet-bag, In which he stored his tracts and soap, And other peaceful swag, Which Indians patronise when war A nd cattle-stealing lag. Long they sat in solemn council, The agent and the red, Mildly talking flabby virtue, Till the sachem shook hia head, As with doubt and dim suspicion ; Then he grunted low and said — Not with eloquence of nature — Not in metaphoric style, But in simpler frontier lingo, Mingled slang and grammar vile — "" Na-ree-trow-zis j want some whiskey; Injun empty ; drink a pile.""

I stared at it for a minute or two before I broke the seal, and wondered what it was about. The post mark was Lowchester, and I felt quite certain that I did not owe money to anyone in that little Lincolnshire town. Then suddenly the idea flashed upon me—Uncle Christopher Beckwith was dead ! I opened the letter and read as follows : ' Lowchester, December Sth, 18SS9 « Sib,—We regret to inform you of the death of our late esteemed client, Chris topher Beckwith, Esquire, of Fenwick Abbey, which occurred suddenly at six o'clock yesterday morning. Iu accordance with Mr Beckwith's frequent commands, we beg to request your presence a*, the funeral ceremony, whioh will take place in Fenwick Churchyard on the 11th hcßtant, at 11,30 a.m. . •Mr Beckwith's will is to be read at the Abbey immediately after the ceremony. 'We are, Sir, your obedient servaute, Sharpe, Kbnnk & Sharp. Walter Marston, Eeq.' I folded the letter and restored it to its envelope, and then carried it to the kitchen, where my wife was making a pudding. I laid the letter before her. • Mary,' I said, ' Cncle Christopher is dead.' She looked up at me quickly, and I saw the same thought in her eyes which bad sprung up in my mind when I first grasped the facts of the""letter. We had neither of us muoh cause to regret the eld man's death, and we were very poor. We wondered if he had left us anything. ' The letter does not say whether he has left us anything or not,' I said, in answer to her inquiring glauce. ' Tiny w?mt me to go (iown to the funeral on the 1 lib. I don't know whether I shall go ' * I think you lad httur go,' said my wife. ' Perhaps the poor old gentleman relented before he died.' I shook my head. Uncle Beekwith was not the man to relent, and the letter said he nad died suddenly. 4 I'll go, Mary, I sm.l, * f you think I ought to. I sin only considering the expense. And I'm afraid I shall oniy have the pleasure of hearing that the money Las gone to seme charitable inst tutior.' I had offended Uncle Christopbt r Beck with, and he was not the nun to t reive or forget it. Tiio facts v. ere very simple. My mother, bis only sister, aud, I believe, ooiv relation, bad msrried a poor clergy man, who dird 1. !'■.•,' befere atlsiuin"" middle ace. leaving his wife and child myself—titaliy unprovided for. Undo Christopher, with much grumllinq and growling, took us into his care ar.d provided for us. When I was ten years old my mother died, and thenceforth Uncle Christopher had full control over me. He sent me to Eugly, charging the school authorities to ground me thoroughly in mathematics. At eighteen he transferred me to Cambridge, where- he made me study science with all my power. Alas 1 I am not of a scientific turn cf mind, and I loved the old Greeks and. Romans— whom UncieChristopher heartily despised. My Uncle was a mechanical genus. He had an elaborate workshop in a quiet wing of the Abbey, in which he laboured day after day at all manner cf curkus and useless things—performing clocks, wind mill?, and similar con trivance?. He often spent months in elaborating these things,and he has wasted years in endeavcuricg to produce inven tions which wem beyond human skill. MeciiauL'ai work was his hobby, and dislike of the female sex was bis prevailing characteristic. I v.as made- fully aware (f this when. I left Cambridge. He called me into his outer woiksLcp—be had an inner sanctum into which no one was allowed to enter—and addressed me with much gravity. ' Nephew Walter,' .-aid my Uncle Chris topher, ' y:u aro 21, and 1 propose to speak to you of ye ur future. You have no money of your c wn, and let me tell you that it is hard wcrk to make money nowa days. I, as you know, am a rich man. Now, I intend to mbke you my heir on two conditions. The first that you devote your life to the pursuits to which I have devoted mine ; tb Q second is, that you never marry.' Alas, and I was in love! In love with pretty Mary Witi.iugtcn, to whom I had plighted my trcth only a mocth before under a certain elm tree in my Uncle's park. It seemed very hard and very cruel. ' Well, why don't you answer ? ' said Uncle Christopher, slarply. 1 1—I don't know, sir,' I replied. ' The fact is—l am engaged.'. • Engaged ? You young fool !—and to whom ? ' * To Miss Withington, sir.' 4 The curate' 6 daughter ! Ob, you idiot, you ate, yen. Well, do as you please. Take a week to thick it over. If you are determined to ruin your prospects, you can dc so. Only remember that you must take yourself away from here and earn your living as beet you can. I shall wash my hands of you.' The following week was a miserable one. I would not give M>ry up. I had made up my mind as to that. But I had no money or no prospects, and I knew that it might be years before I could make a home for a wife. I thought these things fully over, and at the end of the week I told Uncle Christopher that I could notFO far surrender my liberty as to accept bis conditions. I was willing, I said, to wait some time before marrying, and to carry out his wishes as far as I could. But marry I must some day. • You're a fooi, nephew,' he said, bluntly. * and you're not the first man that's been made sc by a girl's face. Now you mutt go out into the world and fight for your self.' I left the Abbey that day, and after a despairing interview with Mary—in which we promised to wait for each other for twenty years if need be so—l went to London and sought an old college friend ibo was awaiting his call at the Bar, and eking out a living by writing for the magazines, I had always had a turn for scribbling, and it occurred to me that I might find the profession of letters a profit able one. I am not going to tell you about my struggles. I worked hard at journalism and story writing, and event ually got a perinauent footing in the slippery arena. At the end of four years I was able to prove to Mr Withington that I was earning time hundred pounds a year. Af'.er that we had a quiet wedding —and Mary was ,nine. We had beeu married two months when the letter came announcing Uncle Christopher's death. I had held no communication with him since the day I had left the Abbey, and I did not thiuk he had torgiven me for preferring a wi/e to meohanioal contriv ances and celibacy. I went down to Lowchester by the early train on the day of the funeral, and found myself at Fenwick Churchyard in good time. I occupied the 3pare moments by glancing at ths objects, interesting to me. There was my mother's grave, and there beyond the church-yard wall the elm tree which Mary and I used as a try&ting place. Then I began to thiuk of Mary, and wished that I had a few of the dead man's thousand? wherewith to surround my wife with the pleasures and comforts the was worthy of. And then oame the faneral cortege in view, winding along the flat Lincolnshire road. It was a verj simple ' affair; a hearse and three mourning coaches, with a sinallgatheriug of people on foot. The ciergyuwncaui* out of the church in surplice and stole, and waked down to the lycbgate, and I followed him as they were taking the coffin out of the hearse. Mr Sharpe, the solicitor, descended from the first mourning coach and advanced towards me. Then the little procession formed, and we followed it into the church, i shortly to emerge and lay all that was left of Uncle Christopher in the vault ' outside. ' Is it absolutely neceesary that I should I accompany you to the Abbey ? ' I inquired of Mr Sharpe. 4 Absolutely, iny dear sir. It waß my late client's wish that jou should attend the funeral and hear the will read. There is a seat for you in the coach.' When we arrived at the Abbey, Mr Shxrie. summoned all the domestics into the great dinis g-rooin. There were do new faces a-i (hem. I remembered thera all, and they had not forgotten mo. Ttie old butltr c'aine up with tears in his eyes, and hoped tliat I was coming into the Afur which, Mr Sharpe, with a pu liminaryc. ugb, adjusted his spectacle? and unfolded the will.' ' Mr Marston,' he said, looking at me, but sneaking so that all could hear, ' this will wa6 made by Mr Beckwcrth on the Ist December last, just a week before he died. There bad been a previous will, which was destroyed prior to the drafting of this.' He- u en cc mmtnced to read in a slow, soleinu tout. lot k:nu. up us be named v.eb bcmliciaiy. Th"" will bet fulth tliat the testuti-r, beir:j_r in sound mind, So:., eiid i t avt I Jo) u WilliauiP, his butler, tin sum c.fone thousand pounds ; to Sarah Jones, iis cm k and houeikeeper, a like sum ; to TnomHß Brown, Iris coachman, live hundred pounds; to every servant who hud been in his i inploy twenty years two hundred pi unds each ; to every person of ten years' standing one hundred pcun's each ; to uli oilier servants nl'.y pounds each. To bin friend, Mr John Sharpe, he betpieathed one thousand pounds. To the incumbent of the parish and Lis successors ho beijiuathc-d the turn of one hundred pounds, the interest of which was to be f.iveu annually to the boy who proved him seii' tut st < lliciont iu mathematics at the village sehoo!. And now Mr Sharpe cleared his throat again and iu kid at me. Every eye was lurned on me at- he continued reading— • I give aid biijuesth to my nephew, Walter Marston, ot ~> York Terrace, Bi»ys water, London, all my house and park of Ft n wick Alley, win. all that is therein, of whatever uatuit-, on condition ' Mr Suarpe v.i-s attacked with a severe fit of c: during which I waited with feverish impatience. ' On eom:hioi; that upon the first day of January in each \far ho shall take the mechanical cieek, which will he found in my study, to the fami'y vault in Ftnwick Churchyard, and shall there place it upon my tomb, titer which he shall at midnight set it in motnn by pressing the spring noticeable nun '.lie left hand corner of the base, and shhil remain in the vault until tie el« ek las cc mpleted its (ftice, which, being dene, he shall carry the clock home, and shall there keep it in safety until the next first < f January, observing that it is not set in motion by his hand or any e.ther hands at any other time than that specified. And it shall give a certificate, signed by two creditable witnesses, to the executors of this, my will, aud to their successors. But upon the first failure of the clock's action these conditions shall become null and void, and the said Walter Marston shall hold the Louse and park of Ftnwick Abbey absolutely. And in cate tho said Walter Marston refuses to accept these conditions, I give and bequeath the house and park cf Fenwick Abbey to the Wor shipful Company of Ckekmakers.' Then came a formal clause about the executors and their powers, and so the strange will came to an end. Mr Sharpe folded the document up, and on second thoughts uufolded it and laid it on tbe table, looking at me as if wondering whether I sbould like to read it. 4 You need not fc-ive your decision just now Mr Marston,' he said. 'lt can be announced to m.yself and my co-executor later on.' 4 I don't thick I need keep you waiting for it, Mr Sharpe,' I said. ' I will give it to you at once. I accept the conditions specified.' He locked at me for an instant with an admiring air. 4 You do ?' he shid, blirost incredulously. ' Will you be really fio down into that vault every-ah, I perceive the servants have not yet been dismissed. That will do, Willihtne.' 4 There is on 6 thing I do not understand,' I shid, when the servants had filed out with Ll we. ' Where is my uncle's money ? He states that the (xact sum of tbe minor bequests is lodged in the Lowchester Bank, but whete is the rest ? He was a very wealthy mac. Where is his money ? ' ' That, my dear sir, is what I asked my late worthy client. He asked me what that mattered to me. Then he growled something about wondering if that young scribbling idiot had any brains in him.' 4 Ah ?' I said. 4 1 tell you what it is, Mr Sharpe there is some mystery in this strange be quest. I see that my uncle leaves me the house and park, and all that therein is. Suppose I find a hoard of money in some corner will it be mine ? ' 4 Unquestionably, my dear sir. Every thing—whether it be a heap of gold or a twopenny walking-stick.' ' And supposing this wonderful clock goes on performing to mo end of my life ? Will my heir, if I have one, be bound to keep up the ghostly praotice ?' ' No. If you turn to the executor clause you will perceive that the conditions die with you, and fall through on its being proved to the executors that you are physically or mentally unable to fulfil them. Bui, my dear ear, that clock will cot perform long—perhaps not at all. I knew Mr Beckwith for forty years, and his geese were ail swans. The clock, my dear young friend will be f jund to be —by- theby, let us go and look at it.' THE WONDROUS CLOCK. We found the clock in my Uncle's study, reposing in stale on a heavy block of marble placed between the windows. It was certainly a most imposing looking piece of woik. It rep;< sen ted a Greek temple, an.) whs wrought in iron coloured to the tint of old hronze by some prooess only known to the inak -r. There were twelve pillars in front of the portico, and from these descended a flight of 6teps terminating in a small courtyard sur rounded by a heavy wall, fashioned in strict accordance with the prevailing style of the temple above. Dial there was none, andwc accordingly ctune to the conclusion that the twelve pillars had something to do with the twelve hours. Closer exam ination proved that behind each pillar was concealed a narrow door apparently giving access to the iuterior ti mple. I looked for the spring. Yes, there it was in theleft handcorner cf the heavy wall which served as a bate for the erection above. With his characteristic love of showeriug his wealth on the inanimate objects of his love, Uucle Christopher had ornamented the spring by setting it in a magnificent diamond. ' Well,' said Mr Sharp,' 'tis a fine look ing piece of work, no doubt. But how any man could spend ail hid days iu fash ioning so much useless ingenuity is more than I can imagine. Ah, there is some insciipiiou or oihc-r round here."" Sure enough. Round the coruice of the temple was an inscription in Roman cap | itals. I drew the curtains aside and read it in the grey winter light. ' It is a couplet,' I said, ' and it seems a mysterious one. Listeu — ' Whene'er my labour proves iu v.-iin, My failure shall be thy great gain.' ' Umph,' said Mr Sharpe. ' And what may that mean ? ' 1 don't know,' I answered. ' But you miy depend upon it there is some mystery connected with this clock. We miiKt w*it till New-Yeai's day and see if we cun get any light on the matter —tb< nin thefsmi'y I hud the sindj c-refnlly locked up aud took the k<-\ i.'.v.-.\ n; my own keeping. Ti.e more 1 ;hoUgiit about it, the more I wished that New-Year's D-ty v\asa! baud. What do you advit-e me to do ? ' 1 asked Mr Sharpe, as I sat over the warm luncheon Cc- re fully served by the old butler. ' I really cannot afford to keep up the Abbey. lam not earning more lhau four hundred pounds a year, aud that would certainly not suffice to keep up this place as it has been kept up.' 'No,' siid Mr Sharpe, reflectively sipping his wine. 4 1 should say you ought to have four thousand a yeur at hast. What my late client did with his money I cannot imagine.' ' Do yon know what he was worth '.'' ' Not exactly. What IJo know is thin. About a mouth ago Mr Beckwith rosined till that he hail —turned it into hard cash, in fact, and lodged the Hmor.ntut the Bank of Eufclaud.' 'Then the Bank of England perhaps still ' ' My dear sir,' said Mr Bank of England dots not now hold a 6iugle penny. liuinediatt ly Mr Beckwith died I wired to the Baijk aulhi ritien reqae6ting tbern to tell rue what they held ofhin. They wired back to.the (flVct that, on the '27 th of November, Mr Beekwith came in per.-ou to the Bsuk and took away his morny in Lis own pocket. The amount wa6 one hundred and five •thous and pounds, and by his own request he took it in one hundred and live notes of a thousand each.' ' Then, where is it r ' ' The next day,' resumed Mr S'narpe, my late client paid five thousand pounds into the Lowchester Bank in five of these notes. That five thousand is sufficient to cover the minor legacies. The questiou is —where are the remainder of the notep, representing one hundred thousand pounds ? ' ' Have ycu made any search for them ?' I asked. • I have locked high and low. I have examined every desk, cabinet, drawer in this house. I and my sen spent a whole day in doing 60, and we could find no trace of them.' * It's very strange,' I 6aid. •Do you think he gave them to anyone ? ' • I don't know. At any rate, my dear sir, we Bhall know if he did, for the Bank had the numbers, and I have ordered them to stop payment until I can be communi cated with.' We sat for a long time discussing my affairs, and decided at lust that I should bring Mary to tbe Abbey in time for Christmas, and that we should wait until New-Year's day before making any final decision. If the money does not lurn up,' said Mr Sharpe, ' I should advise you to let the Abbey. It would briug three hundred a year in tent and tbe shooting would be worth another two hundred. Yon certainly cannot keep it up on your present income.' It was a strange story that I had to tell Mary when I n ached home late that night. It sounded a great thing to be owner of Fenwick Abbey, but it waß not such an advantage as it looked, and my little wife's face assumed a perplexed air as I pro ceeded with my account of the day's events. 4 At any rate,' Bhe said, • we can let the Abbey if we cannot live in it. And five hundred pounds will mean a great deal to us. We spent most of our time that Christ mas in trying to solve the question of the missing bank-notes. All sorts of daring schemes were proposed and abandoned, all manner of wild guesses were made and given up as hopeless. I searched every nook and corner of the house in which money might have been hidden — &vd found nothing. On the evening of Christmas Day, how ever, something like a clue came to light. We had been talking about the mysterious dock, and I had allowed the whole com pany to have a peep at it. This led to a disoussion about my Uncle's peculiar torn of mmd, and at the suggestion of one of the young ladies we adjourned to the workshop, and explored it and the inner room which Uncle Christopher had reserved as a sanctum sanctorum. Tam ing over the strange objects and prying closely into everything ttiat he ooald lay his hands on, Tom Withington found and suddenly held up for our notice, a brown paper bag iusoribed ' Bank of England.' It wss no doubt the bag in which my uncle had folded bis precious bauk-note&, and it seemed to prove that he had brought them to the Abbey at any rate. But further search threw no more light on the matter, and the gleam of hope soon died away. (To be continued )",Fiction

I affirm, without fear of contradiction, that I acted generously. I paid more in the entry than I need have paid ; and, after Mr Harris had bantered me inordinately on my ability to put a horse in condition, I offered to him, publicly, that (the weight our horses were to carry having been fixed at list. 61bs, each) I would place 361bs. more than that weight on my horse, provided he would increase his stake to a certain sum. Mr Harris declined the crushing advantage I offered him, although it was coupled with the further "" pull"" of my hone having to carry & rider who breathed in 1799.

From Pmnoa’s Weekly. Tho march of tho Prussian hosts had shaluiu Prance. At Xvry-sur-yoino, the few men who were left behind after tho last conscription gathered nightly outside the cabaret of 4 °Duß.»n Secuurs* to discuss the situation and road tho meagre reports of tho pr0.,p.,!3g ~p.,!3g of Hie war in tho p ipers. Tho women find children mostly .stayed indoors, the former* full of gloomy thoughts of hus bands, brothers or sons gone to fight for Franco perhaps never to return. Jules LeuKiitre, who did next to nothing nowadays that people seornod to have scarcely time to think of clothes, declared every day and at all times that MacMahon was but leading tho Prussian devils the further into France to annihilate them the more completely. And as ho stated this, seated with h?s Council of War, as he called it, outside tho cabaret, Jean Bour chier would exclaim, rapping the foot of his glass upon the small square table— ‘ Vmi are right, you are right. And so the .Prince of Saxony will find out/ But by Hie middle of August Juloa* face of apprehension pervaded the village, Uho women at their doors gazed a way down tho len*', white, straight road which led to Paris, where General Trochu was with an army,* which, had it been put in motion, Jules* in m-emmls of exultancy declared could have settled the matter at once. Tho papers now came few and far be tween, and the victory which caused Jules to call on old Cesar Boiihomme to produce a bottle of his best often proved a day or two later to have existed only in the imagination of tho writer. Ivry stretched a straggling street along tho high road, far enough removed from tho liver to know littlo or nothing of the passing of gunboat or tho destruction of bridges. At tho ond df the village stood a small two-storied house, detached from its fellows, and commanding the road, placed in the centre of a strip of garden which produced abundant vegetables for - its owner, and a supply for the cure. On the twenty-seventh of August Jules and the tailor, with a knot of associates, came to its front door, which was painted green, and demanded that the house should bo put in a condition of defence. Old Binofc, who knew nothing about military matters, and who did not dream, as Jules did, of the great Napoleon, made no demur. Ciippled by rheumatism,he could do nought to assist their patriotic wishes, but what Jules, who had lost two lingers of his left hand at Solferino, declared was necessary he would not bo the one to oppose. So ho lay quiet whilst his shutters, in which ho took a pride, wore drilled with holes for musketry, and submitted uncom plainingly to tho importation of sand-bags, surplus bedding, and a box or two of cart ridges, which Jules had obtained at Meux, In tho field at the back of the cabaret a squad of old men and girls and women now drilled every night, and in time the latter Overcame their fears of firearms. The army of.lvry was ready to resist the invader. But had it not been for the solemnity of Jules and the great shadow of war which had stolon into the hearts of the women, those who did not drill, but only watched from over the hedge, or from the back windows of the houses, would have laughed. On the last day of August Jules, who was ever on the watch from his seat out side the cabaret, under the striped awning and in the shade of the scorching, blistering sun, saw in the distance down the road a cloud of white dust at a point where it seemed no broader than a piece of narrow tape. ‘ Cesar ! Cesar!’ ho called out in a tone of command mingled with excitement. ‘Yes, Jules. What is it ?’ ‘You fool!’ called out Jules hastily. Come out! Don’t you care enough for your skin when the Prussians are coming ? Cesar came out at last from the shado of the room in which the village cronies gathered in winter, rubbing his eyes as the glare of the white road caught them as though hot irons were passed in front of them. Jules was standing up and also shading his eyes. The patch of white dust down the road was growing larger minute by minute. Surely it hid the Prussians j those pigs whose throats Jules’ fingers and those of the garrison of Ivry were itching to slit. At length a puff of air lifted_ the cloud of dust for a moment, disclosing to the intent gaze of Jules and Cesar a single horseman spurring his horse, ‘ A cuirassier !’ exclaimed the former, as the sunlight flashed back from the horse man’s breastplate, ‘Surely tho Prussians are not close behind him ?’ On came the figure, enveloped once more in a cloud of white dust, and then, almost before tho villagers, who had run to their doors to discover what Jules and Cesar were shouting about, had time to realise the situation, the panting horse, ?ith its neck outstretched and foam covor -3g its chest and legs, was hurtling up tho treet, its hoofs giving out a heavy thud s they struck the dnst-ladon road. ‘ The Prussians advance on Paris ! The Prussians ate coming! Fly! Fly!’ shouted the ridor, as he galloped through the village. ‘ The Prussians advancing on Pans ! J ides stood aghast, stupidly gazing after the rapidly diminishing figure. ‘ Sucre blew ! A thousand maledictions ! AVhero is Bazaiuo ? AVbat is Trochu doing?’ ‘ Ah, yes, that’s it! Is he going to let Us be slaughtered without striking a blow ?’ said Cesar, as the villagers gathered round to hoar what J ules had to say on the matter. ‘lt is all the Emperor’s doing/ ox claimed Pere Guyinet, mumbling because most of his teeth were lacking, ‘ and the Empress. It is her doing. AVhy doesn’t he go and get killed like a brave man ? That’s what I want to know. Oh, they are all fools ! That’s what they are. If only our friend Jules now was at the head of affairs. He’d make the Prussian pigs skip back across the Khino. That is as many of them as had legs left to*run away with.’ Jules was a brave man, as after events were to show, but he laid no claim, even n his inner consciousness, to diplomacy, and so he out short Pere Guyinet’s mum blings. .. . ‘Nevermind the Emperor,’he rejoined, ‘ and as for Trochu, if the Prussians are approaching Paris ho will have his bands full. God aids those who help themselves. If the Prussians como wo will be ready for them. Let us go to Binet’s and see the defences are all right.’ When Jules, Cesar and half a dozen of the youngest amongst the men had set off up the street to the fort, the women broke forth into mingled curses and lamenta tions. They stood, a group of some fifty of them, in the road outside the cabaret, whilst the children plucked at their skirts and asked questions which could not be answi rod. There wore a fow women and half a dozen or so among the elder girls, however, whose hard life in the fields had served to strengthen and make resourceful on occasions when other women wept. Lucille Guyinet, whoso husband (Pere Huyinet’s son) and two boys were with Marshal Bazaiue and the army of the Khine, was one of those. She would bare her breast to the Prussian sabres rather than that the hated invader should pass through Ivry on the way to Paris un checked. ' ’ She was a bravo woman was Lucille Guyinet, and she inspired others with her spirit. ■ . . , , ‘Women,’ she said, raising her right hand on high, ‘this is no time for in action. France is in danger. We have ■riven our sons and husbands to her cause. Let us put aside our women’s fears and play a brave part. Follow me ! Until we know if what the cuirassier said is true we will watch. And if the Prussians come we will aet—will fight beside the men who are left. The Prussians, curses upon them, shail see that even we will dispute their progress.’ The brave words of Lucille found an echo in the heaits of several of those around her. <To Binob's ’ To Bmet's ’. was shouted, and headed by Lucille the group outside the cabaret broke up, and a score or so of the women and girls filed up the street in tho direction of the improvised tort. Jules had seen women on the battle field, and he knejv better than to despise them as auxiliaries. , , ~ n Oh. ves ! There was plenty they could do. Besides, could not Lucille Guyinet, Didon Ballu and throe or four others hit a wine-bottle with a Chassepot at a hundred paces? Then women’s ears were sharp, and women’s sight as good as his own or bettor, and they could be relied upon to keep a good watch upon the road by which the Prussian army corps might oven now be advancing upon Paris. Binet’s house had seen belter days. Once it had been a shooting-lodge or some thing'of the kind, and had been built m the days before jerry-building had como into fashion, and when thick walls were deemed a necessity. It had two windows on tbo side looking away dov.n tho road, and quite a number in the front command ing a view across the street and beyond it over the fields. On the other side and at the back there wore but three or four windows altogether, and these bad been carefully boarded up by Jules’ direction with double plunking of inch deals, between whicli was sandwiched old bedding. In tho roof there was a small room with a fanlight which commanded a view of tho road and tho country round right away to the wood, throe miles off, where for some weeks there had been a piquet ""of Frahc-Tireurs, recently wibh drawn. It was here that a dozen of the women and girls by turns were set to watch night and day, for the full moon in. a cloudless sky had made the white load perfectly distinct at night for a distance of a couple of miles. No thought of the uselessness of resist ance occurred to anyone. They one and all accepted Jules' leadership in such matters, and as for him. he thought only of Franco, poor, bleeding, harassed Franc©—and would have charged a bat talion himself if no one would have fal lowed him. Jules was no dinner-table patriot, willing to spill other people’s blood like water so long as he saved his own skin. * * ■* * A week went by in anxious suspense. Nothing, absolutely nothing, unusual occurred ; and if tho garrison at Iviy hud been lulled Into a sense of security who could have wondered ? A brilliant idea had struck Lucille. There were a dozen strong, sturdy girls, whose field work had given them muscles almost as good as any man's. Why should they be hampered in their soldier's duties by their women s dress ? Why, indeed ? And thus it was that when, on the seventh of September, the guard in the room in Binot s roof reported a suspicious cloud of dust on the far horizon, there were women, but few petticoats, in the fort. At one o’clock the enemy were within three kilometres, and Jules made out that the advancing force was a small detach ment of Prussian cavalry—Uhlans they afterwards proved to be. Across the fields in the direction of the wood all who were not required for the defence of the fort had fled long before they were likely to be detected by tho ad vancing soldiers. Before they went, carrying out Jules' directions, they had barred aud bolted their doors and windows, and now tho village street wore a look, notwithstanding the brilliance of tho sun shine, pf complete and silent desolation. Behind tho closed and loop-holed shut ters of Binet's house,- which commanded •the road and garden, knelt Jules, Cesar, Felix Gallois the carpenter, Etienne Des forges, Lucille Guyinet, Didon Ballu, Lame Rosier and a score of others, ;nen, women and girls, with Chassepots in their hands* and cartridge boxes handy for re loading; The small troop of Uhlans rode forwafd at a smart trot, their accoutrements jang ling ut their sides, their carbines handy and their eyes about them. Tho village was deserted —that was clear enough; and so, though cautiously, thoy advanced steadily. Didon, who was at tho right-hand win dow commanding the road, by peering through one of the loop-holes, could by now distinguish that the officer at the head of the troop was a tall, fair man with a drooping moustache and a hard, deter mined face. When 1 they were within two hundred and fifty metres of tho house Jules ex claimed in a low voice: ‘Are you ready, my soldiers ? Yes ? Then let your aim be for Prance and thohearts of these accursed Prussians!’ Almostwithin a minute there was a deafening crash which shook the house, and froni. the two windows at the side spurted a dozen jets of flame. The t»U 'officer Didon had aimed for threw up his arms and fell with a crash into the dust of the road. Two of the horses were 'down, and another riderless one dame rwsliing down tho road. For li moment the troop was thrown into confusion, and then a lieutenant rode to the front attd rallied the men. In the house there was a suffocating smoke, which made the women cough and rub their eyes with the backs of their hands as they thvust fresh cartridges into tho Ohassepots. Jples gave the order for another volley an,d again the spurts of flame darted from’ the holes in the green shutters, and a couple more of the Uhlans fell. The lieutenant’s voice could be hoatd shouting in Bavarian for half tho men to dismount and fire at the windows, and the rest to follow him to the front, where they Would attempt to break Into the house. Before Jules’ companions could fire again there came an answering crackle from a dozen carbines in tho road, and the sound of the shutters splintering as the bullets struct them. Laure Hosier and Cesar were together at the left-hand window, and almost ere the streak of light had penetrated into tho room she foil over with a sob, with a bullet in her breast. Cesar pulled her aside, and one of the women who had been loading the Chassepots turned her over to see what could be done. When she saw the dark stain on Lame's clothes she took off her apron and laid it across her face, and thou wont on reload ing. A girl at the farther side of the room was sucking her finger, which had been in jured by a splinter. , Considering how close the defenders Were packed in the room, the Uhlans’ fire had not beoU very deadly as yet, Tho next volley from behind the shutters knocked over three horses and a big, bearded trooper, who was taking careful aim across the back of his horse at tho centre of the window, and another of the soldiers was busy binding a handkerchief round his head, which had boon ploughed Up by a glancing bullet. Just as Jules gave the word to fire again, a crash from tho front of the house announced that the- Uhlans were in the road or the garden, and that Felix Gallois and his comrades had opened flro upon them. The women, with faces blackened with powder, and with hero and there a greyish streak showing where the tears drawn from their eyes by the acrid smoke, which filled the room and almost suffocated them, had coursed, reloaded the Chassepots and handed them to those at the loop-holed shutters. Five of the defenders were now down upon the floor, including Cesar Bonhomme, who had fallen Without a groan, shot through the brain, J ules had a bullet in his left shoulder, but scarcely knew it. He was so anxious to knock over a few more Prussians and see what a dust they would kick up. A scream of agony now and again coming from the front of the house told that Felix and his party were suffering from the cross-fire of a handful of the enemy, who had broken in the front door of one of the houses, fifty yards or so down the street, and were firing from the windows. Tules was a brave man, but he know the affair could not now last much longer. Tho shutter behind which he stood was almost shot to pieces, and another volley from the road would probably split it from its hinges and bring it with a crash into the room. Didon seemed to bear a charmed life. She bad bowled over five of the troopers, and though she had had a bullet through the sleeve of her man’s smock, and bad a thick coil ®f her hair out away by another shot, she had escaped unhurt. A bugle spoke down tho street, and with a parting volley which sent tho shutter crashing from its hinges, the Uhlans leapt into their saddles and vanished round the corner of the house. The strong sunlight streamed into the room showing the carnage that had taken place, the dark, half-congealed bloodstains on tho floor, the grimy faces and bloodshot eyes of the survivors, and the five dead and three wounded. In a cornet Nanuetto Clorfond, the village beauty, whoso light flaxen hair had enmeshed the affections of Jean Mavguery, now with the army of Paris, lay on her back in half shade half sunshine, with her hair spread out on the floor in the shapo of a fan, and her hand on her heart, which a stray bullet had found. Half tho garrison wore either dead or dis abled. Surrender was the only thing left to them. Both tho shutters in the front had come in with creaking crashes under tho withering fire of tho Uhlans in tho house down the street, and the women who had borne their wounds bravely were now sickening at the horror tho sunlight showed. Before Julos could say what was in his mind there were two or three straggling shots fired in the front rooms, and then Felix Gailois was heard shouting out that tho Prussians were coming to break in the door. At the same instant heavy blows were rained upon the windows at the back, which in a few minutes gave inward with a crash. Didon, with her eyes blazing, hastened to the head of the narrow stairs, Chassepot in hand, and when the lieutenant thrust open the door at the bottom he fell hack into tbo arms of his sergeant without so much as a groan. Then there was a rush up the stairs. Didon was hurled half stunned back into tbo front room. There wore several deafening explosions of car bines and Chassopots, and the defenders were overpowered and secured. Half-an-hour later they were brought into tho garden, where the surviving officer of the Uhlans, Captain Adolf Shacffer, was seated at a table. Tho women, all dis hevelled, and tho girls, with their faces and men’s clothing blackened with powder, and splashed and streaked with blood, excited no feeling of pity in tho Uhlan’s heart. Ho had mot with an unexpected chock for half-an-liour or more, and those same women had emptied a third of the saddles of his troop, 'had killed the com mandant and lieutenant, and now ho had something to say. The half-dozen old men, Jules, with his arm hanging useless, at their head, were ranged on one side of the path, and the women on the other. Captain Shaeffer was in a hurry to make a junction with his superior force, but he had time to say a few words to the peasants who loved France enough to cause them to so madly oppose his force. One of his men spoke French fairly well, and through him, resting his arm on Binot’s sitting-room table, which had been brought into the garden, the Captain of the Prussians spoke. Turning to Jules ho said ' You know the penalty of becoming a combatant, and so doubtless do your follows. It is, therefore, needless to waste words over yon. ‘ You will be shot against yonder wall in ten minutes. I am in a hurry, but t £P VO you ten minutes in which to make your preparations/ Adding, with a smile 4 You are all of you old, you will not have missed much of life/ Then turning to the women he con tinued — - , * We Prussians do not shoot women, ana as we have no time to take you along with us, you can go, after you have seen what resistance costs/ , Didon Ballu, covered with blood and smoke, and with her boy's smock torn open at the throat, broke away from the Uhlan who held her. and came to the table, ‘lf you shoot these old men, Monsieur le Capitaine/ ah© exclaimed, * you must shoot me. For the time lam a man. Do you know f have knocked five of-your cursed troopers off their horses ? Not a man has done more/ * You are a mad woman/ replied the Prussian, when her appeal was interpreted. ‘ Do not be a fool! You are reckoned with the women in petticoats. And thank your lucky star it is so. Sergeant, that wall will do. See that the men are ready/ The Sergeant had seen a good deal of this sort of thing lately, so he used, no unnecessary words, but, with half-a-dozen of his men, shoved Jules and his com panions against tho wall, and drawing up the platoon at a dozen paces distant, waited for the command. The women were sobbing, but tho hand ful of patriots, grey-haired and battfo sfcuined, against tho wall faced their conquerors unflinchingly. The brilliant sunlight mercifully dazzled their eyes, so that'they scarcely saw the signal given. Just as the Prussians levelled their carbines Didon wrenched herself free and rushed to Jules' side. With one hand holding her smock at the throat, she raised the other high above her head, calling in a steady voice : ‘ Vive la France! Down with the Prussians!' She stood, a slight figure, with her long black hair tumbling down beneath her cap over her shoulders, besides Jules, grasping his hand, waiting for tho volley. * A soldier stopped forward to drag her away, but the Captain, seeing Jules had clasped an arm round her and remembering that time was passing, motioned him to desist. A moment later, at tho fall of the Sergeant's hand* the carbines crashed their volley of death, and when the smoke cleared there was but one figure standing against the wall—Didon’s. For a moment she remained upright in the sunshine, and then she swayed and fell over on Jules' body with a thud. Ilalf-an-hour later Capitain Shaeffer and the survivors of his troop cantered down, the village street on their way to join the army corps advancing on Meux. Behind them they left a frightened group of women standing in tho road watching the smoko ; and flames pouring from the windows of Binet's house. To-day in Ivry-sur-Seino market-place stands the statue of a woman all dis hevelled, with uplifted hand, dilated eyes, and evidently speaking. On the marble plinth is inscribed : To those Who foll, covered with Eternal Glory, near this Place on the Seventh of September, 1870. And to Didon Ballu, who loved Franco Bettor than Life.",Fiction

Mr Allen noticed Audrey's abstraction, and surmis ing something of the truth, proposed that they ppend a couple of weeks travelling and sight seeing. But Audrey languidly objected, paying; she preferred the quiet and. solitude of their mountain r»_ treat. But something happened to change this decision. A number of the neighbours planned an excursion to a neighbouring mountain, where they went every year to gather ra?pberue« for winter pve-eives, and, thinking it might be an enjoyable novelty to our city friends, they extended an invitation to them to accompany the party. Audrey and Rich wero quite sure they would enjoy it ; but Mrs Allen thought the distance too great and tho exertion too weaibome for ono of her yoava and preferred to remain at home. When the day arrived, however, Audrey was suffering from a nervous headache, and unable to leave her bed. Rich was greatly disappointed, and would gladly have remained at home with her, but, she insi?ted that he could dc hei no possible good — that he mu«t go ; so he finally, though reluctantly, consented There was a party of eight besides him self, four of whom wero young people. They worked busily all the fmenoon, and pails and basket-"" were rapidly filled with tho fragrant, crimson fruit, and when tho dinner hour camo every one was hungry for the cold chicken, tongue, and ham, bread and cheese, and doughnuts, and all those homely dainties that never ta«te as well anywhere ol^e as they do in the country Then, as they lounged about, after they had dined, for an hour or so before resum ing their berry-picking, Rich, boy-like, started off by himself upon an exploring expedition. He loved the mountains and forests : they inspired him with awe and reverence by their grandeur and strength. "" They are the eternal hills, Aunt Audrey,"" he had said on the evening of their arrival at that Vermont farm-honpe, and drawing a deep bteath of appreciation, while his thoughtful glance went up to the summit of the verdure-crowned mountain^* before them. He loved to wander about, and was always hunting for some rare and beautiful trophy to take back to Miss Waldemar To-day he came across some lovely gray lichens, and knowing how delighted phe would be with them, he fashioned a little basket out of some slender twik's,decorating it, with partridge vines and berries, and then filled it with his treasures. ft was a dainty little woodland offering, and after it was completed he went on climbing the steep mountain side, until suddenly he emerged from the dense forest into a road. He looked surprised at finding himpolf upon the highway, while a little way below him he espied a horse and carriage drawn up upon one side of it, under the shade of a large tree. There was a lady sitting in the carnage alone, and leaning back among the cushions as it either weary or ill. The horse was very restless, for the flies were worrying him, but though the lady held the reins and spoke to him soothingly from time to time, he was still very impatient. Thinking that his assistance might be required, Rich advanced, and saw that the lady was an inyaiid. She had very dark glossy hair, large, beautiful black eyes, which, however, had a very sad expression. Rich lifted his cap politely as he came up to the carriage, while he asked, with heightened colour : ' ' Are you in any trouble, madam ; is there anything that I can do to help you ?"" The lady leaned forward at the sound of his voice, and' smiled pleasantly upon him. as she replied : ' ' "" "" • "" There is nothing tho matter, thank you. only I was very thirsty, and my husband lelt mo beneath the ahrido of this tive, whih he wont back to a spring further down tho mountain, to got mo a dxink.

Looking back ho saw a huge black snake wriggling and winding his way actors the road, sweeping its coils ovei tho horses very hoof-? as it went., find then disappear ing among the bushes beyond The animal gave u staitlcd prnii, rcaied upon \u< hind feet, andy/asd v/as about, to pis o frantic plunge torward, when Kirh, with wonderful presence of mind, sprang to his side, seizing him (irmly by tho bndlc, and then ho befjan to pat him softly and to talk to him reassuringly. The l'idy in the carriage hud uttered a cry ot affii»ht, then sho sank bick among her cushions, palo, and almo-t fainting. "" Do not be alarmed, madam,"" said Rich. ""The horse will be quiet in a few moment?."" Ji-Hfc at that instant he heard a quick step behind them, and glancing back ho saw a noble-looking man approaching, beating in his hand a silver cur> tilled with water. ""What is the matter?"" ho questioned, bonding a look ot alarm upon hi? palo and trembhngwife, and then turning a surpii&ed glance upon Rich. The lad explained what had occurred, but taking the blame of it all upon himself for having disturbed and routed the stiake fiom his hiding-place. "" Uere, Ida, drink some of {his water— it will revive you, and you have nothing more to fear from Prince,"" the gentleman said, passing vhe cup to his wife, and gently releasing the reins from her almost con vulsi\ r e gra^p. She sat up, smiling faintly. ""I was very much startled,"" she said, "" and if it had not been for this young man I am sure Prince would have had a frightful run."" ""I do not doubt it,'' herhusbandroturned. { * Some horses are mora easily frightened by a prake than human beings are.

""Are you feeling better, Ida?"" the gentle man a-ked, as hi& wifw drained the cup of its contents and set it down on the cushion beside her. "" Yep, thank you, I am much refreshed, thouyh a triile weak yet The water was deliciou<ly pure and cool,"" she answered, striving to speak cheerfully. "" Would you like another drink from the spring ?"" her husband asked. Rich t-prang eagerly forward. ""I should be very glad to go and get it for you,"" he paid. ""No, I thank you ; you are very kind, but 1 do not need any more,"" she replied, smiling, and bending a wistful look upon his dark, hand&ome face. ""But I should like to know your name, for I shall always remember you very gratefullyr "" My name is Richmond Waldemar."" Rich saw her ca«t a startled glance at her husband a^ he spoke his last name, and following it ho noticed that the ruddy colour all faded out of the face of tho p r oud man, while the hand that was smoothing his need's glo^y coat began to tremble. "" ""Waldemar— ""Waldcmar,"" he said, in a meditative tone, while he bent down to pick a wisp of hay from Prince's leg, "" I used to know some people of that name, years ago. I wonder if you aie a— a relative oi a— Miss Audrey Waldemar."" ""She is my aunt, sir,"" Rich returned surprised that he should know anything of hor. "" Your aunt ! I did not know that sho had a brother."" "" No, sir, ?he never did ; but I was given to her by some one when I was quite j oung, and I have always called her Aunt Audrey."" ""Ah i yes -yes; I hope she is well,"" and the gentleman's lipa twitohed painfully over tho words. "" Very well, I thank you,"" Rich answered wondering at the man's increasing omotion. ""Arthur, isn't it time we were moving on ?"" his wife here interposed, in a tone that struck Rich as being: somewhat plain tive, and glancing at her he =aw that she had grown very sad and was watching her husband with an anxious expression. He started as if suddenly recalled to him self, and going up to her said, gently, and with an accent of self-reproach : ""Yes, yes, it is ; and you must be very tired, dear."" Prince had become entirely composed by this time, and Rich, leaving him, picked up his little basket, which he had so carefully deposited out of harm's way before tho ex citement, and held it out to the pale woman. "" You are pleased with this, naad^m,"" he said, modestly ; "" will you accept it ?"" Her face, lighted, and rich thought her great dark eyes the loveliest he had ever seen. ""Thank you, dear,' she said heartily. ""I shall bo so glad to have it, and I shall arrange thcee mosses and lichen on card board, and frame and keep them as a souvenir of this day "" Rich flushed with pleasure that she could care enough for his modest gift to take all that trouble. "" I wish 1 had something to give you in return,"" she added. ' ""You surely deserve a medal for your courage and presence of mind to-day.

He slipped it upon the third finger of his left hand, and it proved to be iust a fit. ■ ""lam glad you can wear if-,,"" the lady said, with a pleased smile; ""keep it to remember me by, rand I hope we shall meet again come timo.""

One sunny afternoon in the autumn of the year 18G1, a soldier lay in a clump of laurel by the side of a road in West ern Virginia. He was asleep at his post of duty. The clump of laurel in which the soldier lay was in the angle of a road which, after descending southward a steep acclivity to that point, turned sharply to the west, running along the summit for perhaps 100 yards. There it turned southward again, and went zigzagging downward through the forest. At the salient of that second angle was a large flat rock, jutting out from the ridge to the northward, over looking the deep valley from which the road ascended. The rock capped a high cliff; a stone dropped from its outer edge would have fallen sheer downward 1000 ft. to the tops of the pines. The sleeping sentinel in the clump of laurel was a young Virginian named Garter Druse. He was the son of wealthy parents, and his home was but a few miles from where he now lay. One morning he had risen from the break fast table and said, quietly : “ Father, a Union regiment has arrived at Graf ton. I am going to join it.” The father looked at the son a moment in silence, and replied, “ Go, Carter, and whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty. Virginia, to which you are a traitor, must get on without you. Should we both live to the end of the war, we will speak further of the matter.” So Carter Druse, bowing reverently to his father, who returned the salute with a stately courtesy, which masked a breaking heart, left the home of his childhood to go soldiering. By con science and courage, by deeds of devo tion and daring, he soon commended himself to his fellows and his officers.; and it was to these qualities and to some knowledge of the country that he owed his selection for his present perilous duty at the extreme outpost. What goo-S or bad angel came in a dream to rouse him from his state of crime who shall say ? Without a movement, without a sound, in the profound silence and the languor of the late afternoon, some in visible messenger of fate touched with unsealing Anger the eyes of his con sciousness— 'whispered into the ear of his spirit the mysterious awakening word which no human lips have ever spoken, no human memory has ever recalled. He quietly raised his forehead from his arm, and looked between the masking stems of the laurels, instinctively closing his right hand about the stock of his rifle. His first feeling was a keen ar tistic delight. On a colossal pedestal, the cliff, motionless at the extreme edge of the capping rock, and sharply out lined against the sky, was an equestrian statue of impressive dignity. The figure of the man sat the figure of the horse, straight and soldierly, but with the re pose of the Grecian god carved in the marble which limits the suggestion of activity. . For an instant Druse had a strange, half-defined feeling that he had slept to the end of the Avar, and was looking upon a noble work of art, reared upon that commanding eminence to commemo rfl-to tli6 deeds of svn heroic psist, of which he had been an inglorious part. The feeling was dispelled by a slight move ment of the group ; the horse, without moving its feet, had drawn its body slightly backward from the verge ; the man remained immobile as before. Broad awake and keenly alive to the significance of the situation, Druse now brought the butt of his rifle against bis cheek by cautiously pushing the barrel forward through the bushes, cocked the piece, and, glancing through the sights, covered a vital spot on the horseman’s breast. A touch upon the trigger, and all would have been well with Garter Druse. Alt that instant the horseman turned his head, and looked in the direc tion of his concealed foeraan—seemed to look into his very face, into his eyes, into his brave, compassionate heart. Is it, then, so terrible to kill an enemy in war —an enemy who has surprised a secret vital to the safety of one’s self and comrades —an enemy more formid able for his knowledge than all his army for its numbers ? Carter Druse grew deathly pale ; he shook in every limh, he turned faint, and saw the statuesque group before 'him as black figures, rising, falling, moving unsteadily in arcs of circles in a fiery sky. His hand fell away from his weapon, his head slowly dropped until his face rested on the leaves in which he lay. This courageous gentle man and hardy soldier was near swoon ing from intensity of emotion. The duty of the soldier was plain ; the man must be shot dead from ambush—with out warning, without a moment’s spiritual preparation, with never so much as an outspoken prayer, he must be sent to his account. But no—there is a hope ; he may have discovered nothing—perhaps he is but admiring the sublimity of the landscape. If per mitted, he may turn and ride carelessly away in the direction whence he came. Surely it will be possible to judge at the instant of his withdrawing whether he knows. It may well be that his fixity of attention—Druse turned his head and looked below, through the deeps of air downward, as from the surface to the bottom of a translucent sea. He saw creeping across the green meadow a sinuous line of figures of men and horses—some foolish commander was permitting the soldiers to water their beasts in plain view from a hundred summits ! Druse withdrew his eyes from the valley and fixed them again upon the group of man and horse in the sky, and again it was through the sight of his rifle. But this time the aim was at tbe horse. In his memory, as if they were a divine mandate, rang the wox*ds of his father at parting ; “ Whatever may occur, do what you conceive to be your duty.” He was calm now. His teeth were firmly, but not rigidly closed ; his nerves were as tranquil as a sleeping babe’s—not a tremor affected any muscle of his body ; his breathing, until suspended in the act of taking aim, was regular and slow. Duty had conquered ; spirit had said to the body : “ Peace, be still.” He fired. An officer of the Federal force, in a spirit of adventure or in quest of know ledge, had left the hidden bivouac in the valley, and, with aimless feet, had made his way to the lower edge of a small open space near the foot of the cliff. At a distance of a quarter-mile before him, but apparently at a stone’s throw, rose from its fringe of pines the gigantic face of rock, towering to so great a height above him that it made him giddy to look up to where its edge cut a charp rugged line against the sky. At some distance away to his right it presented a clean, vertical profile against a background of bine sky to a point half of the way clown, and of dis tant hills, hardly less blue, thence to the tops of the trees at its base. Lifting his eyes to the dizzy altitude of its sum mit, the officer saw an astonishing sight—a man on horseback riding down into the valley through the air ! Straight upright sat the rider, in military fashion, with a firm seat in the saddle, a strong clutch upon the rein to hold his charger from too impetuous a plunge. From his bare head his long hair streamed upward, waving like a plume. His right hand was concealed in the cloud of the horse’s lifted mane. The animal’s body was as level as if every hoof stroke encountered the re sistant earth. Its motions were those of a wild gallop, but even as the officer looked they ceased, with all the legs thrown sharply forward as in the act of alighting from a leap. But this was a flight! Filled with amazement and terror by this apparation of a horse man in the sky, the officer was over come by the intensity of his emotions ; his legs failed him and he fell. Almost at the same instant lie heard a crashing sound in the trees—a sound that dies without an echo—and all was still. After firing his shot Private Carter Druse reloaded his rifle and resumed his watch. Ten minutes had hardly passed when a Federal sergeant crept cauti ously to him. “ Did you fire ?” the sergeant whis pered. “ Yes.” “ At what ?” “ A horse. It was standing on yonder rock—pretty far out: It is no longer there. It went ovefl.the cliff.” The man’s face was white, but he showed no other sign of emotion. “ See here, Druse.” the sergeant said, after a silence, “ it’s no use making a mystery. I order you to report. Was there anybody on the horse ?” “ Vpo ” “ Who ?” “My father.” The sergeant rose to his feet and walked away. “ Good God !” he said.— “ Public Opinion.”",Fiction

Tom and Gip walked lazily along with extended ,: tongues, as Prew and I sauntered round the shadiest side of the garden. We spoke little,-ray mind being full of the .incidents and conversation of the '^aorning •■ while my companion was -either,^similarly preoccupied or in the ..happy icondition of having nothing to ( think about but hiß cigar. We looked ever'the quickset hedge at the rough hardy fellows busy in the cornfields. It Is probable I thought of them and their^ work .from my knowledge of b<sth""""froih childhood; it is equally probable! t&at Walter saw only the c <pF6'rjhg and grouping from an artistic ""point of .view. We passed on at any trate.twithdut exchange of confidence ]rjre came, to the entrance gate ?of the/grounds, when a chaiso drove Tapidly through, its; occupant being an .elderly, thin-faced man clad in black, who-, saluted us in passing. Drew Saluted 1, the stranger in return. ■'{ < Who is he?' I asked. i-.i JMyv: uncle's--lawyer, Mr Greig, by all .that's mysterious J' he exclaimed, but' with ,a' smile that belied the mystery s©"" far as he was concerned. *""Wnat'can have happened to bring old parchment •, here,, above all places 1 There's something big on the board, *fchat;S certain.' And Drew gave a droll laugh that!suggested an arriere pensee. We continued our stroll along the southern ' wall ; till we reached my father's novel studio. I tried the door in a'p\rrpo3eiess way. It was locked, and_l kne^y my\father always carried the key- in his pocket; so we passed on, smoking indolently, till Drew | suddenly stopping and facing me, said : 'Do you know, Charlton, I think it ...a most singular thing that your father.and.name should have been such intimate friends as they appear to have been, Snd that the colonel should also be.an ©Id friend of your father's, whilst it was-only by the chapter of accidents that you and I came together.' '.The reason seems simple enough,' I replied, smiling at his unwonted •earnestness. *My father: was unaware that tke colonel had married your aunt, if indeed he even knew of her exist ence.' As for yourself, he was under the impression that you had died when ;a child. 1 ' Yea,. yes * the reason is plain,' answered Walter. ' But—don't you think, now—the whole thing is like — like a leaf out of a romance, you know ; strange,"" queer-like—eh V [ His round jocund, face had the odd, half-whimsical look which was its only expression for sentiiaent He knocked the ashes from the end of his cigar, then eyed me from behind this mask till I could resist no longer, and laughed outright. • Hang it, old fellow,' he said, ' you ■won't let me he serious when I would ; but for all your laughing, there is something uncommonly queer in it all. Perhaps you wanted to enjoy a good joke or two at my expense ; still I can't help thinking, mon ami, that it •was t«o bad of you not to let me know from the first that your good kind soul ©fa father was the friend of mine.""' What could I say ? Had he learned anything of the history of that friend ship 1 These thoughts were swiftly interrupted by Drew, who had again assumed hia mask. ''Look here, John,' said he in a voice comically plaintive ; ' you have not been quite frank with ine on an other Matter. You saved my cousin's life; .yet, when you came to know it was my cousin, you were mum on the subject. Now, I call that unfair.' He paused, as though to give me time to speak; but-1 dai*ed riot trust myself to reply. Had he looked ten times as ' serious,' I could not even have smiled. * Ah, yau know it is,' he continued. ' Well, I can forgive you for that; you were too genuine to chatter about ■what you had done. But while I may even admire your silence to me, I can't for tho life of me see why you should ""be bo stand-off-ish with my cousin Alice.' : 4 Drew !' 1 Nay, .' John,: ■ I will speak. You ""know how much I prize your friend ship, and can a real friend be blind 1 I know you love my cousin, and who has a better right? Why not, then, my d«ar fellow, make her and yourself happy by saying so Y -As he spoke, a slight vertigo seized me ; I saw the trees and Tom and Grip following one another in a circle; the ground under me reeled curiously, and the figure of my friend expanded and contracted like a reflection in a moving mirror. . ' IVEiss Alice !' • I at last contrived to say. ' Why, I thought you' 'Thought I,was in love with her? There—you drop another secret, which I was shrewd,enough to guess before. You are the prinee of good fellows ; but, don't you know—if I did love Alice, Alice 'did not love me. I can't make & speech like a fellow in a play. All I -want to say is this—T can't have Alice, if I would ; and you may, if you but ask.' And Drew, with the wistful look in his hazel eyes which I have remarked as a peculiarity of his when seized with emotion, took ray hand and pressed it warmly. Then, with that singular elasticity of tem perament which no one eould credit unless in contact with him for some time, he relit his cigar, passed his arm through mine with the air and carriage of a man without a care, while we resumed our walk. We had not gone far, when the new train of thoughts induced by the above incident was interrupted by a servant approaching us saying : 'If you please, Mr Charlton wishes to speak to you both in his study.' I marvelled somewhat at this formal summons ; but Drew seemed to think it the most natural thing in the world, as I could tell by his instantly hastene.d stride. We reached the house together and entered the study. There, seated at the table, with a variety of docu ments between them, were Mr Greig the lawyer — who had arrived in the chaise — Colonel Stanton, and my fa ther. . ,The lawyer and the colonel appeared to have been in pleasant con verse, for, as we entered, their faces were still wreathed in smiles. My father, oh the other hand, looked seri ous, if not a little agitated. The smile disappeared from the lawyer's face as though it had been snuffed out, but that on the old warrior's lingered into a kind of pleasing twilight. The for mer, who was evidently president of this conclave, waved to Walter and me to be seated. ' We have sent for you two young gentlemen,' he said in a professional tone, 'to make you jointly acquainted with matters with, which Colonel Stan ton, my client, and Mr Charlton have already discussed. The late Mrs Stan ton, whose agent I had the honor to be, . died possessed of a considerable fortune in her own right. This she naturally left to the free disposal of her husband, and so far the matter might have rested there. But Mrs Stanton took a strong interest in the career of her brother's oialy child — yourself, Mr Drew — and expressed a wish that Colonel Stanton should treat you as a son, and assist you out of her estate in any way, and to such extent as circumstances might suggest and warrant. That estate has remained untouched in my hands up to this time. Now, there were circumstances in the history of the late Mr Drew, which, had Mrs Stanton been aware of, would have caused her to dispose of a large portion of her means during her lifetime, seeing that he died without having the opportunity of — of putting his afFairs straight himself. Colonel Stanton is quite certain on this point ; and he has desired me to arrange, out of his wife's estate, a settlement in full of certain liabilities under which he has recently learned the late Mr Drew lay with, respect to his friond the Rev. Mr Charlton. We have been alto gether unable to obtain Mr Charlton's consent to accept any quittance beyond the strictly clear claim which pertains to certain bills he indorsed for Mr Drew, and for which he became liable on — on his friend's death. The colonel will now explain his intentions with respect to the • remainder of the pro perty.' And Mr Greig laid himself back in his chair with the air of a man who had discharged a duty to his own satisfaction. 1 The fact is, young gentlemen/ said the colonel with military brevity, * Mr Greig shall divide it equally, and place the sums t© your respective credits.' I was mute ; nor can that be matter of surprise. I looked first at one, then the other, as though to read in their faces whether I had heard aright. The colonel and his lawyer conversed aside ; my father sat in a kind of stupor ; Drew looked happy enough for all the party put together. ' You will see, my dear Oharlton,' at last said the colonel, taking my father's hand in his, ' that although I am bound to resjoect your scruples — over-refined as I consider them — neither- Walter nor myself, nor, I may add, my daughter, could possibly rest under'the reflection that your son had been practically disinherited by us. That hardship we are by this arrange ment enabled to avoid. But what, except yosr own conscience, can ever repay you, my dear old friend, for the noble spirit in which you have borne this terrible burden so long !' ' God bless you, Charles !' was all : my father could say, as, after wringing ! the colonel's hand, he rose to leave the i room. Walter took his arm and lod him gently out, and my heart went out towards my friend as I observed this simple action. ' I am delighted, John,' said the colonel kindly addressing me, ' that you and Walter are such good friends. Your influence for good with him has already been immense. The friendship of a steady earnest character like your self was really what he wanted to make him a little more thoughtful and amenable to ordinary social rules. I hare great hopes of him yet. He is really an excellent fellow at bottom. Yon will fce glad to hear, that when I told him, only a week ago, when he was over at the Manor, the sad circumstances of his father connection with yours — which, by the way,"" I only gathered by acci dent from an old friend of my own and of your father — he was beside himself with grief, and vowed to make over his own income for the redemption 01 his father's name. I then told him , — what I had from prudence hitherto concealed — that I considered him my wife's heir. He absolutely refused to touch a penny unless your father were #rst reimbursed. That was what I longed to hear, and what I am proud he was able to say.' Thus had I two tokens given me in one day of Walter Prow's practical adoption of my father's formula of ' honor and friendship,' and thus had events happily compensated him who held it as a. canon of conduct. A laughing party stood in the porch of the rectory. The colonel gallantly offered his arm to Aunt Marjory, who, blushing and smiling, was led off down the garden path. ""Walter paired off with Miss Winter ; my father and Mr Greig, who was to remain to dinner, trotted off in the direction of the studio; and I was left alone for the first time in my life with Miss Stanton. Her face was turned towards me, and I j observed a warm blush and ' timid downward glance as she placed her .tiny ; gloved hand upon •my proffered arm. . Our friends were nowhere within sight. We followed the direction they had taken so far as we had been able to keep them in view, and then, pur posely, I chose a path the least likely to lead us to them. The timidity of my companion's step made me conscious that she had divined my thoughts, and 1 hastenad to converse as freely as my own agitation would allow <s& any sub ject that had the consideration to pre sent itself. The attempt was a very unsatisfactory one, so much so that by the time we had reached the honey suckle arbor to which my steps had led, Alice nervously expressed a wish to turn in search of her father. It is too late, in this ray last chapter, ■to record the details of what there and then toanspired. Alice could probably narrate what occurred better than I can ; but J may here mention, that before our return, ' the last of all that band,' to dress for dinner, we did so as affianced lovers, awaiting only the pa rental consent and benediction. The dinner passed pleasantly. I was supremely happy, and thought eveiy one else ridiculously dull in comparison, although for that matter their looks belied the impeachment of dullness. How it made my heart bound with gratitude t© see the smile, free from care, that sat on my father's venerable face, and to listen to hia genial laugh, to the merry classical quips with which he entertained the colonel, or the graceful badinage with which he amused my aunt and her young friends. JSTo more bitter wear ing cares for him ! Alice sat in si lence, the . silence of profound happi ness. Walter's face shed a brig liter lustre of smiles than ever. My good Aunt Marjory was probably the gayest of the party, and quizzed me with her brown eyes as often as she decently could ; but, happily, I was now invul nerable. That evening I sought an interview with Colonel Stanton, who gave his hearty consent to my union with his daughter. He said he could desire no better' future for his child than to be the wife of one who had been an affec tionate'soil and a magnanimous friend. He referred gratefully also to my earli est claim upon his daughter's interest. It thus came to pass that Aunt Mar jory's prophecy was fulfilled, for, six i months after that eventful day, Alice and I were married at Brierleigh I Church. I rcmst mention that on the same day and in the same church, Walter Drew led Miss Winter to the altar. His engagement had not been"" of long standing, but he insisted on the ■' event3 7 coming off together. It only remains to add that Walter and I remain fast friends, and that I am proud of his rapidly growing fame as an artist. At the colonel's express wish, my own professional career was nipped in the bud, and my ambition directed towards tho field of politics.- — Chambers's Journal. gm«iaflmu«j>i»innmTiiniiirii«iiiiniiiiii»imß",Fiction

Sir,— l have read with much pleasure, the very able letter of your correspondent, Dr. Kingdom, which appeared in your paper of the 26th Septem ber I have nothing myself to say upon a subject which has been so well handled by a man of science, but I wish to impress upon the minds of the community a few ideas, for which lam main ly indebted to our Resident Magistrate, Jos. Flight, Esquire. There seems to me to be so much practi cal good 6ense in those ideas, that I trust they will be appreciated by all men, who are not mere job bing hucksters. Providence has poured upon tl>e shores of New Plymouth an inexhaustible supply of wealth in the shape of ore, somewhat r sembling in its granula t'd appearance the tin ore found upon the shores of Cornwall. Tin ore rendered England famous, even in the. days of the Phoenicians, when the natives of England were savages, and ran about unclad' ; and Iron Saud will reader New Plymouth famous ia these later days. Let there be no exclusive privilege gran 1 ed to any peison -to use this wealth for his own advantage, or to the detriment of all other men.* Let an application be made to the proper nu tboritie's, for appointing commissioners, to enquire and find out by whom the advantages of this pre cious metal have been discovered, what compensa tion they ought to receive, and what expense they Have really incurred^ and lot every person who thinks fit to do so employ his labor and means in smelting the ore, under pioper supervision and upon payment of a fixed royalty, and ""let that royalty be expended Qrst in rewards and reimbursements to those entitled, and afterwards in constructing a Breakwater, Pier, or other secure refuge, for vessels approaching this dangerous coast, and in tome other public and local improvements. The neTtt suggestion is my own, ' beware who the commissioners are,' and let no man in this place, whatever his position or pretentious may be, be suf fered to be nominated a commissioner. I have been professionally concerned for Mr. Charles Martin, an engineer, in London, and I pro cured for him, whilst I was in Auckland, a patent for an improvment in the manufacture of [the Iron Sand of New Plymouth. That invention consists in a particular mode of charging the furnaces neces sary for smelting opeiat!ons. I shall write, to my client bythe next mail, asking his instructions, as to the tprnis upon which he will grant licenses to use his invention, and I will take especial care that no unauthorised person sha l ! pirate his invention. I believe, there is no person here, who has taken more trouble, or who has incu-red more expense, (considering hi""! means) lhan Mr. Perry, in testing the qualites of titaniferons sand, he has shewn what perseverance can accomplish, and I shall recom meud Mr. Peviy esppf'-illv, to the notice of my client, as a peison entitled lo his kind consideration, and I will endeavour lo prevent any one, from pock eting a reward, so justly due to Mr. Perry him self.

He was a grim man, and generally remarked little that did not concern bis work. He was reminded of her childish days when she used to prepare “ sur prises ” for him, and he thongbt that after all she was little changed by lengthening of frocks and twisting her hair up. She had no remarkable beauty from any classical point of view ; yet Sibyl North was pretty, and had a nameless charm that is more potent than perfection. Mr. North was a widower with a family of six, of whom Sibyl was the eldest. She bad the happy tempera ment that is not rutiled by the thousand-anil one small worries of life. She kept bouse for her father, and helped the governess with ttie children’s lessons. She played cricket with the boys in the held behind the house in the holi days. She mended stockings and patched youthful knees, she knitted and read to her father. She had always a lap or a bosom to be cried on by the five-year-old boy or the six year-old little sister, and could comfort either and turn their tears into smiles. She packed for the brothers when they went to school, and bid a cake amongst their clothes to cheer their home-sickness. Mr. North was a silent man, who had given himself up to books. He was short in bis manner, and bis children regarded him with awe. To Sybil did he only show the warmer ide of his nature, and she was looked npon ns a mediator. He liked to have her with him, and put into her willing bands much that was precious—and tedious, too—of his work ; and she copied for him and made copious extracts. “ I should like a picture of you,” he said cue day, suddenly. Sybil looked up in surprise. *' A picture, father ?” “ Well, a photograph,” be said, speaking slowly. “As a family, this has been neglected Your mother died, aud 1 have no likeness of her.” He said nothing more, and the subject dropped. Sybil went on with her work of cor recting proofs. From the study window shecculd see the waves beating on the shore. The vicar age stood on the Cornish coast. It was on the outskirts of a fishing village, and four miles from a town. The smell of the sea and the taste of brine were in the air, aud the waves broke with iusistance. Mr. North’s birthday was approaching. Sibyl made a mysterious visit to the town, and he re-' meinbered afterwards her look on that day. The children were getting up a play, and he un bent somewhat, and quizzed them. “Bat Sibyl’s got a real surprise,” said Mabey, the youngest girl. “ Hush,” said Sibyl. m “ The mysterious visit to the town?”said Mr. North. "" Be quiet, father, you’re not to know.” said Sibyl. “ Mabey, I tell you nob to say a word about it.” “ Yes, Mabey shall have her tongue tied,” cried one of the boys. "" You little tell-tale,” said the other, and Mabey subsided into tears in Sibyl’s lap. Mr North watched her as she soothed the little thing’s distress. How gentle she was! “ There’s a spring tide to-night,” said Arthur ; “ Jack and I are going to Tether’s Point to see it. Old Tremlin says it will be one of the highest ever known, and there’s a splendid sea on’already.” The younger children clamoured to bo allowed to go too. “ No,” said Sibyl, “ you, Willie and Mabey, must stay with me. Tether’s Point is too far for you to walk ; besides, it will not be high tide before your bed-time. Elsie, you can go with them if you like, but you must put on your strong boots, and tell nurse to tie my woollen scarf across your chest.” Willie and Mabey began to protest. Mr. North silenced them. “ Sibyl says no, and that is enough,” he said —not another word.” Their mouths turned down, “ I think they might come down to tlbe beach,” said Sibyl, seeing their disappointment. “ It is only Tether’s Point that is too far. Mabey, be good and ask father if you may come down with me for a quarter ot an hour before going to bed.” Mabey shrank back behind her sister’s skirts. “ But Sibyl meant to go to Tether’s Point herself,” said Elsie; “you know you did, Sibyl. You told me so. You wanted to see the waves.” “ I can see them just as well on the shore here,” said Sibyl. “ Why should you sacrifice yourself to these children ?” said Mr. North, testily. “ Why can’t their governess take them ?” “ She is lying down with a headache, and nurse has a cold, and 1 can’t send one of the other servants out to-night. Besides, I like to go with the children.” “ Wei), just as you like,” said Mr. North, crossly. He went to his study. The wind was roaring round the bouse and the waves thundered oh the shore. Be settled to bis work. Presently he heard the boys and Elsie starting. Then he heard the pattering of Mabey and Willie, and their excited voices calling for Sibyl. “ Coming, coming I” sounded in her voice from upstairs. He heard her bounding lightly down with a jump at the last four steps, and as she passed the study door be called to her. “ What is it, father ?” “ Nothing. I want to kiss you, that’s all. “ Dear old father.” “ I am a bear sometimes.” “ Never, father. Never a bear to me.” “ Sibyl!” “ Yes, dear.” “ Do the children love me ?” “Yes, are a little bit sharp with them sometimes.” She laid her face against his. “ Try to be gentle with them. „Tl,ey are children. They don’t understand.” “ How good you are, Sibyl.” The children bad opened the ball door and admitted the four winds of heaven.. “ Now I must be off,” she said. He never knew what made him follow her to the door and there kiss her again. Half-an-bour passed. The vicar wrote that night a sermon he never preached. . The texl was taken from Proverbs xxxi., 29th, He beard the children come in, and he called to them. “ Where is your sister, dear!” he asked of Mabey. ' * She sent us in because it was time to go to bed, and sbe has stopped to see the sea, and so we’re to go to nurse.” “ And ob, the seas’s so rough,” said Willie, “ And there are great big, enormous waves as big as—oh, ever so big ! And Mabey’s hat nearly blew away, and our coats are quite wet ” ‘‘ Go and take them off, my boy. Good night, little man. Good-night, Mabey. Run along.” Sibyl stood on the beach and watched the sea., Every wave seemed to dig into the shore as it broke with the crashing of a thousand guns, and then rushed up the sloping shingle. It bore the stones back with a grinding sound. Foam lay like yellow snow in a long line that was washed higher and higher. How the wind roan cl and the sea thundered ! Sibyl breathed a prayer for all who were at the mercy of the waters. She stood looking, with a fascination that made her heedless of all bat her fancies. | Then her heart stood still. A blackmuuutain was advancing towards her. Had the whole sea heaped itself into one stupendous wave ? There was the noise of the crushing of a world. In his study the Vicar looked up from his sermon. “ What was that ?” he said aloud. There was silence in the bouse, and then a screaming. The vomen rushed from their quarter. “ The water’s coming up the garden.” The maid who spoke was white to the lips. Mr. North went to the door and opened it. fhere was a sound in the garden that had never seen beard before. It was the rushing back of bhe water. It flowed down in a flat sheet (o the basin of the sea. “ A tidal wave,” said the Vicar, “ it will not sccnr again.” “ I thought it was the end of the world,” said the nurse. “ It’s a mercy the children were in. But where's the boys and Miss Elsie ? ” The Vicar threw up bis arms. “ Sibyl! ”he said, “ Sibyl! Where is Sibyl ? My God ! don’t tell me she isn’t with yon.” The servants looked at each otter in blank affright. No one had seen her. No one bad heard her come in. “ Can’t you answer ? ” said the Vicar, turn ing to them such a frenzied look as not one will ever forget. They shrank back. Nurse began to sob. Mr. North ran down the garden, splashing through the water that had been left in pools upon the grass The sea had fallen back to its accustomed place. There was nothing on tho beach, but high up the line of yellow' foam. The Vicar ran hither and thither on the shore. The women followed him keeping close to gether. He stopped and faced them. “ What shall I do ? ” be said, helplessly. “ What shall I do P ” “ Where are the boys and Elsie ? ” said Nurse. “ Tether’s Point. They are safe—but Sibyl, Oh, dear God, Sibyl 1 ” Some of the parishioners gathered dn the shore. The servants ran to them. Old Tremlin said no boat could put out in such a sea, and if she could what good P” “But, Miss Sybil,” he said, “it can't be true ; the Lord couldn’t let it.” The night was spent in search. Parties were organised and sent out in both directions. From Tether’s Point came the boys and Elsie. “It washed up to within a foot of us. Did you all come out to see it P” “ Was Sybil with you P Have yon seen Sybil ?” They had not. With white faces they joined in the search. The pitiless sea fell back yard by yard, and with the dawn the wind dropped. It was many days before there lay one day at dawn upon the beach that which had once been Sybil. It lay still in the grey light, and the ripples washed to and fro gently the hair that looked like seaweed. Then the waters fell. They bad done their worst, and they gave buck their plaything to the earth. Th post brought a little packet to the Vicar on his birthday. He opened it without interest. But it held Sybil’s photograph.",Fiction

Homeless I humanity sought shelter in nooks and corners of the Thames Embank ment, in dark caverns beneath railway bridges, under the deserted arcades ot Covent Garden —Heaven knew where else - and Sorell, in this respect, was nearly as prescient, having tested the accommodation of all these refuges one after another. It was three weeks since he had slept in a be J, as his aching hone- testified, and yet, thanks to the charity of a miserable woman, who had some experience of, and pity for, the ineradicable instincts of gentlehood the rents of his coat and trousers were darned with some neatness, and his solitary shirt was, in the favouring moonlight, im maculately clean. His hair and moustache bore witness to the .-kill of another waif, a broken-down barber, once a West Enrl hand, who had been glad to operate for a halfpenny and the stub-end of a cigar. The moon had sped away southwards, chased by a shrill, piping wind, the eyes of the stars were blinded by drifting scarves of greyish vapour. Only Cassiopeia twinkled clear above the squat <pire of St. Martin's church, and Polaris shone with piercing brilliance, as though it were the diamond pivot upon which the whole heavenly system turned. Not that Sorell knew much about the heavenly system, or any system but a gambling one, and that had not justified his confidence. He had had heaps of money and spent it, and owned throngs of friends and lost them—as a natural consequence, and he accepted this knowledge without any Timon-like bitterness. Had not he in his heyday shunted such decadents as and , glad to get rid ot them at the price of a handful of cigars and a hve-pound note ? A rive-pound note ! How many of those crisp, delicious bits of paper, crack ling with pleasant possibilities, had net he spent, lent, lost, or given away, in the days that weie gone for ever ! Whatever his faults were, want of generosity had not been one of them. He would have been glad, in these latter days of downfall, to meet a fellow as open-handed a? tie him self used to be. He laughed aloud at his own conceit. But the brief, hoarse each in tuition woke such uncanny echoes all about him that the very lions crouching at the foot of Nelson's Column seemed to bristle with dismay. Sorell hated loneliness as ardently as most men of his type hate it. He would have given his cravat—silk, and yet quite passable —that a fellow outcast had been there tc share his vigil. But, though depressed and slovenly figures ap peared from time to time, slouching east, west, north, or south, before the authorita tive tramp of the policeman, not one turned aside. That functionary had not yet ceased to address Sorell as "" Sir."" The unmistak able signs and tokens of breeding survive ihe social ruin and physical decadence ot woman or of man, even as the shape of the Chippendale cabinet which stands in the lodging-house kitchen distinguishes it from common articles dedicated to usages as common ; and the itdaid arabesques and paler curves of the stringing assert them -elves thiough the dust and grime of decades. It would tike over much of time ano space to tell how Sorell came to the base merit. We have only to deal with a smal portion of his experiences while there. His case was. analagous to that of the urchii who, htving licked all the jam from th< upper side of his crun, finds himself re dnced to the necessity of consuming tin dry bit flavoured only by memorie.- sacchrine. He made the comparison hiir, self and found it irritating. For twelvi hours he had not eaten, and he knew now the meaning of u bread riot. One wa gering on inside hnn ; ~nd he had beer. mesa-president of a crack regiment in hi time, and steward of a sporting club. Hi 1 - brain, stimulated to activity by abstinence, kept formulating endless programmes o' succulent repasts. He was, in truth, in evil case, but, though miserable, did not feei wretched. Because he had reached that stage of the downgrade when a man cea*es tograsp at straws in the endeavour t"" check his course, knowing that the final crash is close at hand, when he will be beaten into oblivion and nothingness. And Sorell meant to hasten the denouement. To-night, before the shops were shut, he had entered a smart chemist's. The head assistant looked supereilliously across the i; muter as the shabby swell lounged in, then paled an I bit his lip, anil came for ward hurriedly :u Sorell nodded "" Good evening."" "" You know me, Terill ?"" "" Captain Sorell ! My brother George's .•Id mister ! We- no offence, «ir, btii we thought you were dead.' "" 1 have bem dead,"" Sorell laughed, with an echo of the old circles* gaiety. The electric light was pitiles-.

I'm bound to oblige you, vou know."" "" Oblige me, then, as quickly as you can."" Upon this whispered altercation ensued a silence, only broken by the clinking of ,i phial against the neck of a squat vessel,the stopper of which had been so carefully se cured with leather that it took some moments in withdrawal. A faint perfume of almonds made itself perceptible through the sweet soapy odours of the shop. The tall man in the seedy, fashionably cut clothes, who stood leaning easily against the counter, heaved a sigh of satisfaction and relief as a tiny white-paper-covered parcel slid into his outstretched hand. "" I am—or shall be- eternally obliged to you. Good-night and good-bye."" The chemist's working partner looked after the retreating figure until it was lost to .sight. He could contemplate the conse quences of a fatal mistake in a prescription with some amount of composure, but he had never before deliberately poisoned a man. Meanwhile Sorell went forth and wan dered, with a strangely renewed vigour and an elastic tread, under the blazing lamp.*, past the flaring shop windows, through the noise and bustle of London by midnight. And the stroke of twelve found him in Trafalgar-square. Well ! He wouid have done with mortal needs and human companionship before the morning, and yet the loveliness of this, to be his last night on earth, pierced him like a sword. He strolled round the fountains, silent now, and looked about him. The soles of his worn boots made no sound upon the dingy pavement, moistened now by a slight shower of rain. The half-hour struuk and then the third quarter. It would soon be time. For the first time the crawling shudder of physical dread came over Sorell. That little parcel in his breast pocket struck a chill to his heart as if it had been a lump of ice. The love of life rose up and grappled with lie overmastering desire or death. Di/./.y with the struggle, feeling beggared and lonely under the cold stare of the mid night sky, he turned aside into a welcome nook of shadow, and leaned, panting, in an angle of the wall. There were no human eyes, he thought, at hand to note his weak ness. So the tears of pity for himsell rolled down his cheeks, and he sobbed under cover of the darkness like any woman. It seemed to him a monstrous t.hing that Jim Sorrell—-old Jim—who had sinned no more than other men, and had. even at his wor.-t,such a lot of good in him, should be driven to do this thing ! He was passionately sorry for himself. Something moved near him. Something touched him. A stray dog ? No ! for it was a wasted little hand that reached up out of the trough oi shadow lying at the bottom of the wall, and laid itself timidly upon his sleeve. "" A kid, by George !"" said Sorell. Every nerve in his body had jerked with terror at the uncanny, unexpected touch ; and ho was anxious to conceal from him self the fact that he had been frightened. "" It's not a kid,'* said a sweet, plaintive voice with a thrill in it of wounded feeling. "" Jt's a woman."" '• Then if you're a woman,"" said Sorell, looking down, "" don't sit there upon this damp pavement, unless you want to catch your deal h of cold."" '"" I'm not sitting,"" returned the voice, speaking at the level of his knee. "" I'm standing."" "" Then, good Lord I "" began the bewildered Sorell. "" Don't take his name in vain,"" said the voice rebukingly. "" I beg your pardon,"" stammered Sorell. The vagrant moon shone out just then from behind a mass of drifting sky-wrack, and all answering gleam came back from two large and plaintive eyes that were raised to her. Sorell spoke, in his confusion, mil ecilely •'Aren't you afraid to be here at this tune of night, by yourself ?"" "" Look at me,"" returned the plaintive voice, "" and see."" His companion stepped out of the shadows. She was only three feet high. She was distorted and misshapen. Nothing was there of the grace of womanhood about her, save the shining eyes di.it looked on! of a pale little wizened face, and the »'oice i hat was so sweet and plaintive. For her i here was no danger, wander where she might by night or lay unless, injeed, men became ravening wolve- and preyed on human llc-h ; but no! till then. Sorell spoke with a smarting spa-m if i'iiy •• Have you no home to go to ':"" "" I've got a hone-, thank Him ' It's only ~ti atiie iii Seven Dials and up a many -i;i:rs ; but I manage to pay m> lent, and it's clean and decent.""

""So it was for him you cried ! Oh, can't you help him ?"" "" It's too late."" "" It's never too late to help. That's why I come here regularly, rain or shine, winter or summer. I've waited in this corner from twelve till halt-past one every night for four years -except two, when I was ill and couldn't walk. Oh, if she should have come one of those nights, and gone aw;iy again !"" She moaned in the darkness, and wrung her wasted little hands together. "" Will you tell me who ' she ' is ?"" '• She's my sister. She was so beauti ful, and straight, and tall. Not like me. who am crooked, and little, and ugly. We lived together when father and motherdied. That was eight years ago, and -he was just sixteen. She must be twenty-four now. I lost her on her twentieth birthday. Oh me !"" "" Don""t tell me if it hurts you,"" said Sorell gently. "" It doesn't hurt, and there's the chance that you might know someone who knows her. We got our living—working. I did buttonhole-—I do 'em now —and she was a waitress in a restaurant. She was good, but folks spoiled her with flattery. She was kind ; she came home every evening cheerful, though she was tired, and never grumbled much at our poor food, and she'd take ine out for a walk, sometimes, after dark, when people couldn't see to jeer at me ; and—and- one night she never came back.

"" It's Rhoda Lakin."" "" Rhoda Lakin !*' Sorell's heart gave a sickening bound and recoil. Something ser-med to snap between Ins temples. The overshadowing sky dome, the vast masses of architecture, the grim black statues, the silent fountains, Nelson's Column, with its couchant lions, wavered and melted, shrank small and loomed gigantic, before his swimming vision. To be confronted, as one turns to make one's farewell congee upon the thres hold of the world, by the reproachful spectre of an old sin ! "" You've heard of her,"" said the dwart quickly. "" You know her ';"" She pointed a lean imperious linger in the direction oi a patch of moonlight that shone upon the pavement some paces away. "" You go and stand there and let me look at you ':"" Sorell obeyed passively. He was wonder ing whether there might not be some film of truth in what religious folk said about the Finger of Providence, and so forth. Blind chance could hardly have wrought to such an end as the bringing of Rhoda'.- -educer--once so irresistible, now so fallen and degraded- and Rhoda's hunchbacked .■ister into company. He remembered th passionate fits of self-reproach, the bursts of tears, with which his victim used in tin early days of what he had promised should be her honeymoon—poor pretty, vain, easily deluded creature !—to allude to hei abandonment of Lizzie. Little by little, however, the edges of conscience had j blunted. Drop by drop the fount of tears, ihe oil in the cruse of love, had dried up. Guy Rhoda, rattling, reckless Rhoda, a -he was now, had ceased to be a slave an,i become a task mis tress--ceased to be a lover, and hecome beloved. She had helped him to squander his thousand.- gaily, had helped to plunge him deeper and niott deeply into debt ; had sat upon the box -cat of tiie coach, as he had said, and -houted with Bacchanalian laughter as the ponderous machine swayed and creaked and thundered downhill, and then, just befort the crash a year ago today—she had jumped off cleverly and safely, with aid ol alio!het's hand. The hand belonged to hit' sworn chum, and had grasped his in friend ship a thousand times. But what tight had he to talk of treachery ? The dwarf scanned him eagerly, standing on tiptoe to get a nearer view of his haggard "" You're a gentleman—or you were one dot so very truth ti a little thing like me. l)o yon know my sister Rhoda ?""

Sorell struggled with himself for one strenuous instant, and then dashed the deadly little bottle on the pavement, and crushed it under his heel. The dwarf hobbled on before, he followed, humbly, with stooping shoulders and bent head. They drew near the shadowy corner which had harboured both, at their first meeting, not half an hour ago. And as they did so, a woman's shape,tall and lithe and smoothly moving, glided out of the blackness, and fell upon its knees before the dwarf. And a wild strange cry of mingled joy and anguish went up to the hearing Heaven : '' Lizzie ! Lizzie !"" "" It's Khoda ! ,: "" Oh, don't turn against me, now that I've come back !"" '* Is it likely ?

Among the mysteries imbedded in this story, as they are usually obscured in stories, is the character of Piunie. The “Tiger” re mains something of a mystery for the pres ent, and whatever he lacks, or fails to realize on, in any other way, he takes out of Pinnie’s back. If the slavish condition of the slender, white-faced boy did not. indicate otherwise, and the history of the youth contradict it, we would suspect that his archi tectural elements were borrowed from “Smike.” But whatever wei’e the other unfortunate suri’oundings of poor Smike. he ceatainiy went to school! Pinnie had pos sibly never even seen his name in writing, and he was in no sense a coward except in the line of his ignorance. It hardly appears that he had never seen the world—even the city world. An American youth, who had lived eighteen years in one square—in a section sux’rounded by the sea, and had never seen it! “Impossible,” says many a tendei’-heart ed person, to whom the thought is quite ridiculous. But it was neither impossible nor at the pinnacle of strange realities. Spanei’o had brought him up for a purpose. He was a servant in the block where we find him—a whipped spaniel. A thoroughly broken spirit—broken before it had ever seen the rack or the boot. And yet there was an unutterable some thing in this boy’s being which accepted the burden and the bars, but beat against the prison walls of ignorance—something ever beckoning to the crushed soul to rise. The body did not rebel—did not know there was such a thing as rebellion I But the hopes by day and the “silent watches” by night were ever active and unfettered. He had felt the flutter of things unseen; the possible, as a light in a dark gallery. With the few fellow slaves who toiled for bread, ho talked but little—asbame:! of his ignorance but anchored in the b-lief that his daily wants were more surely provided for than their own. The channel of thought was narrow—even the phosphorescent glow of a dream was too oyerpowering. Upon awakening, the glow was extinguished and lost. Upon this benighted life came the gentle knowledge of a love—a love which made no claims because it knew of none. A love that asked no sacrifices, but would have offered a sacrifice of all. A love of which he was unconscious, like that of a child who frets his mother before he weeps over her dead form, having lost her. He loved not as a lover. And to Helen Lamont he was ready to go to have the burden of his ignorance re moved. Up to the time "" Helen Lamont appeared upon the plane of his life, only two persons knew the cavern in which his life was devel oped—Spanero and himself. And this in an American city. Bahl We can show you wretches whose lives would lie darkling in lower depths than that of Pinnie —lives besides which Pinuie’s developing would shine like the glory of the sapphire germinating in basement dens, where the skinny finger of poverty is lifted by the cor rupt body of a depraved heredity. Tha “Tiger,” as Spanero was spoken of by the painters, was in a sense a miser. He was known to be enormously wealthy, for those times, and it had been whispered that a large portion of it was not only hidden in secret vaults, but was obtained in some not legiti mate manner. He lived in the “school” building, and rarely left the square. For years he had rented one of the frame buildings, on the least respectable side of the square, as a restaurant, to a fellow-Spaniard, giving the rent for the board of himself and Pinnie— delivered at his rooms. Pinnie had been under interdiction in the matter of going outside the square from childhood and fear of strangers had not only been taught him by his master, but the edu cation had been improved upon by certain secret influences, which will appear hereafter. No street bands ever disturbed the City of Boston in those days, and the ordinary tumult failed to pierce the enclosing walls. With the exception of the kicks and cuffs, Pinnie’s life was blank. He noticed that if a good painter accidentally entered the “ school,” he said but little and soon disap peared. The poor ones remained for years. The school was evidently profitable, and at the same time kept alive the slumbering love which Leon Spanero still held for a profes sion in which he had been remarkably skill ful. Ho was an artist. He never took up the brush in vain. Ha was a mystery in him self. One summer day he sat in his outer office in a “brown study.” He leaned over on the old leathei’-covered desk, which squeaked with pain whenever its master moved. He there, fore bad a fondness for it. His face was broad and fair—rare construction for a Spaniard. Before him lay the card of the chief of police. “What the devil?” And then he studied another quarter of an hour—and still more—and again muttered, “the devil,"" as if his majesty were his prime minister in emergencies. Pinnie sat on a box about four yards away, with his back toward him, mixing some deli cate tints. The tiger emphasized his mental exercises by picking up a book and throwing it at him. It struck the boy in tne back of the neck, lauded on the paint slab aud lay there in the daub, ruined. Pinnie merely turned his head and said, as if spoken to, in a whisper: “Yes, sir.” “What the devil did that man come here for—to find out about that painting for? Hey?” “I don’t know, sir,” meekly said the one addressed, who had as little idea of what it was the tiger was talking about as we have. “Of course you don’t, you idiot! As a pro found idiot you’re a success. You are my success!” The boy turned around and steadily rose from his seat—slowly and nervily. He ap proached the tiger, who watched him with curiosity—seeing in the youth’s eyes and action something he had never observed be fore. “Master what did you say? What was— was—l?” Spanero replied, without the trouble of a frown, “Get to your seat, whelp, or I’ll cut your throat from ear to ear. What is it to you what 1 say?” This was the first time the boy had so much as looked the tiger in the eye. He stood still a moment. The bravado of the world had never reached him. Every muscle moved to the mind like a clock to its pendulum—and he did not flinch. Leon Spanei'o saw and realized that he was looking upon a splendid sight. It was a pale, sickly stripling in the den of lions. The artist’s wonder at what his “success” would do was intense—for an artist, be he angel or devil, is a student of the passions. To his regret he saw the youth quietly turn and go to the box from which he had risen, resuming his work at the mix tures. “Was it fear?” asked Spanero of him self. The reader can answer the question when he has read further, but Spanei’o an swered it at once. “How can a slave know fear—they made gladiators of them in the Roman day.” And then came back his meditations. “The Lady of Luraine—Luraine — Luraine—there was the old French Marquis, a half-brother of Montableau; yes, and one of Bonaparte’s favorites. That family was Hugenot, and broken up a generation ago. There is no Lady of Luraine now. She painted a pic ture, did she? Why do I stay in here like an old fool, instead of going out into the world and fighting for fame? Luraine—can’t find her! Thumbscrews! To think that that uniformed cub came here to find a painter? I’ll find a way to twist him if he has any tricks in his bonnet! And yet—how do you know it was a beautiful woman, and an un known, too? There never was or will be but one woman who can paint—and I have her— ah, ha, ha, Plnnie, you dog ” “Yes, sir.” “Go to the workroom and tell Miss Lur aine ” Did not Leon remember that Pin nie had executed certain commissions for the girl whose image had just entered his mind, and would not Pinnie reveal his knowledge when thus suddenly addressed? He watched that face with a masterful eye. It was vain. The pale youth was as mo tionless as a statue. “Miss Luraine, I said,” shouted the man. “Pardon, sir, I do not remember her.” “Well, boy,” and he softened suddenly, “go and tell Miss Lament that I wish to see her. ” Pinnie withdrew and soon returned, Miss Lament following upon his footsteps. “Miss Lament,” said the master, in a tone of quiet interest, “do you know a lady by the name of Luraine?” Helen was not dull of comprehension. She was especially on her guard with Spanero, who was evidently treating her with more kindness and condescension than he extended to any of the other pupils, of either sex. She might have refused to answer, or ""she might have confessed to the knowledge. At present she knew nothing of an offer of SSOO for the painting of “The Angel of Sympathy,” and —told a falsehood. She suffered therefore, as most people do who do not tell the truth. Her daily bread depended upon her work in this den, so far as she at that moment knew, and she fully realized that even here she was improving in her execution. Through Pin nie, whom no one knew, and who little dream ed the play he was enacting, she had succeed ed in entering the picture incognito, and withdrawing it successfully. But the honors she had never claimed. She had her own reasons, and good ones. Without a shadow on her face she answered: “No, sir.” “You do not ?” “I am acquainted with no one of that name 1” It was done. And in another moment she was punished. The reader will discover that our heroine is not perfect. She had hidden under the excuse that she really knew no one of that name—not counting a “nom !” Alas, when heroines fail in moral courage, what can be expected of the weaker ones ? “ Ah, Miss Lu-Lamont, lam very sorry.” It was very surprising to Pinnie over in the corner of the room to hear his master speak so kindly to a pupil; and, unlettered as ho was in the weakness of his race, a formless, shadowy fear of ill entered-into.his mind. But the secret and oppressive fear which came to Pinnie unbidden was not, at least not at that time, the real motive prompting Spanero’s softness of speech. Money, fame, commercial values, these took precedence in the emotional disturb ances which moved in his breast. He saw fortune in a girl who could put up SSOO pic tures while an inmate of a commercial art room at $5 a week! Besides, Leou’Spanero was an artist talk ing to a greater. He thought it possible that' in this beautiful and spirited girl he had found an undeveloped Raphael or Da Vinci —he had not seen the picture, bu t had heard of the money value put upon it. “You see, Miss Lamont—pray be seated— Here, Pinnie, clear off this chair here and give the young lady a seat; what are you thinking about?” “I prefer to stand, Mr. Spanero. I have been sitting for four hours!” “That is true—too hard for you, Miss Helen. But to return—if I knew where Lady Luraine is I could be of great use to her.” Evidently he had some lurking suspicions, and proposed to probe the matter further. He continued: “I have an offer for her of a large price—a very large price—for a pic ture she recently painted.” Miss Lamont did not exhibit any real sur prise, but there was an invisible something which signaled the truth to Spanero. Not conceiving of any object, however, in denial he was mystified. He was satisfied now that Miss Lamont was in a position below her sta tion, and the old Luraine titles were in his mind. To the last suggestion, Helen made no response; but it occurred to her that this man was representing another, and she was far from sure that she wanted to transact busi ness through the commercial artist who was not even a member of the academy. “Miss Lamont,"" he continued after a pause, “you really have an ability which led me to suspect you of being the party we are looking for. You are too capable a person to be engaged in drudgery.” Clear-headed Tiger—he knew she would find it out soon and why not he be the bearer of the message? “If I can be of any assistance in these mat ters, I am anxious to be in your service.” “There are no steps which I wish to take at once,” she answered, dreading his atten tions. “I can at least pay you higher wages.” “You do; sir, in the fact that I do more rapid work.” “But you do better work.” He was not in the least put out by her want of apprecia tion. “No, because better work is not what you require—one could not be better without the others being worse,” urged the fair philoso pher. ,*• He was forced to smile. “I will advance your rates to fifty cents per copy.” “No, Mr. Spanero, not to me—give it to that poor, one-armed girl. She is suffering for it. ” “Miss Helen, this is not a poor- house.” “Sir?” said the girl, indignantly. “Oh, never mind, no offense, my good girl. You have a tender heart as well as a skillful hand. The cripple will have an ad vance at once, and so will you. And I make the suggestion that while you cannot go to Europe yet, to study, that you use your ad vance in pay in the purchase of books on art and coloring—let these home painters alone, unless they come to take lessons!” “I thank you, Mr. Spanero.” “Never mind that now. Miss Lamont, if tou will let me guide you to a certain ei tent; that is, take an interest in your fare, I will make you famous. I don’t say this through love of money, or any personal interest, but solely to give the deserving all the aid in my power.” At this time Pinnie ceased to grind colox’s and began to grind his teeth. “Sit down, Miss Helen. Yes, my young genius, I will do all I can, and, in return, will ask but a single favor—a favor with out sacrifice.” “Anything that is within my power, Mr. Spanei'o. ” “That you take me not as the rough, hard man that I appeal’. I am oue of the great army of disappointed men. lam an enthusi ast in art. I succeeded so well that, where as I painted good pictures and sold them for trifles, others copied my ventures and grew, rich out of them. In a dismal hour I left true art —passionate art —and entei’ed into this miserable commercial life.” Helen listened to him with marked intex-est, and so did Pinnie! “Yes, I make aid; an auctioneer, and bring oxxt the woi’k by the squai’e yai’d. But I have prospei’ed, Miss Helen. lam practical ly a prince in this young x’epublic.” Here the interest of hid\ beautiful auditor failed. She thought of the poor homes in the gari’ets of those who made his wealth for him. “Yes, I am able to live as a prince; but wealth will not take the place of friend six Ip.” The tiger was not over-cunning now. Ho had alarmed his pi’ey—so ho reassux-ed her. “Do not be alarmed, Miss Helen. All that I desire is to be x'egarded as a counsellor and guardian—in art, nothing else.” “Mr. Spanero, you will please accept my thanks for your kindness?” “To show you that I am anxious for your welfare,” resumed the Spaniai’d, “I extend this confidence to you at once. This cai’d I secured for a pupil because her culture and ability demanded recognition. You will please use it. •’ He handed her a plain bi’istol board upon which was printed as follows. • MRS. KATHERINE NORTH. i • ASSEMBLY e. americus. : : THURSDAY EVENING, 23d INST. I i 9-13 P. M. FERRY FOOT OP ELM. She took it in her hand, and he explained that all there who went as strangers would need no further introduction than that cai’d. “I suppose you have some elderly friend who will go with you to the door!” “I am vei’y grateful to you. I have wanted to go to the art assembly. I have friends who will aid me.” “This,” said Spanero, “is the first card I have ever obtained, and I was sure it would ■iloase you,” “How can I express ray thanks?” “By letting me assist you in every possible ,v ay. Let me know’ your hopes, your aspira tions,” and he di’ew his chair nearer to her. 1 Let mo—Pinnie, go and finish your Italian sunset!” “Pinnie,” said the girl, in clear tones, “re main whei’e you ax - el” The tiger did not change color, nor move a uscle. “Pinnie,"" he said, “x’emain where ou ax’e.” Pinnie remained. Miss Lamont resumed her seat with diguity. But the tiger was no fool. He saw his hand and played it. “That is all, Miss Lamont, to-day. You may return to your work.” The xuastership, respectful but assertive, returned, and Miss Lamont could only x’ise and depart without a word. The door closed, ■ the footstep was heard crossing the hall, and Miss Lamont was out of hearing. Spanei’o passed quickly to whei’e Piunie sat. The expression upon his face was al most demoniac in its wrath, his eyes gleam ing with malignity. He grasped the boy firmly by the clothing about his neck and jerked him headlong to the middle of the rqom. “Now, you infernal devil, you blind beg gar, w hen I am having a talk of that kind, why do you wait to be ordered out of the room, idiot? Because you don’t know enough to sneak out, puppy?” He followed his words with a brutal kick. It was followed by no cry—nor the next— nor the next. “You white-livered sea-brat—l’ll teach you to know when your absence is wanted!” He raised him to his feet, but the boy sank again, limp and nerveless. “Get up, fool! Or shall I stir you with this bloodletter?” And the brute drew a , slender stiletto from his bosom. The boy opened his eyes, raised himself halfway from the floor, opened his mouth to speak, groaned and fell back unconscious, “Take your time for it,” hissed the infuri ated monster, as with a giant’s strength ho flung the body into a corner. Ho then lock ed his door, aud thouce retired to his private room. ’ To be Continued",Fiction

Sir, — Myself and another old settler determined to take a country ride the other day as the weather was suitable. The district we selected to explore was Tikorangi. Taking into consideration the wild state in which this part was but a few years since, when bush, tutu, and fern prevailed, the contrast is striking in the extreme. Now good open roads are made, and well feucad farms laid out and eub-<livided with taste into paddooks; these paddocks are, many of them, well loaded with dark green crops of wheat, &c. We reached the blockhouse, situated on the summit of a high hill, with a very com manding view of the country, and with glimpses of the winding Waitara River, as also of the houses which are now springing up ou either side of the stream. The blockhouse, whioh was once occupied by military men, is now inhabited by one who took part in the destruction of the Crimea, and who has now laid aside the profession of war for the peaceful life of an agiiuulturist. As we descended from the higher ground, our attention was attracted by a family party of males and females v, ho were busy gathering hay and stacking it. We were then taken round a block of fine high standing wheat, which bids fair for producing, say, thirty bushels per acre. We were much sur prised to see the condition of this farm, since the owner (Mr. Hicks) had not been niuoh more than twelve months in the Colony. We were still further pleased to hear him deliberately state it to be his opinion that at the prpsent prices realised for crops, farming will pay the proprietor when it is attended to as it should be. — I am, &c, Q.",LetterToEditor

Though the apartment was not lara;e, io was famished and decorated with a minute and careful effors ux> ulegance and refinement, and a desire to avoid what was mean and rude, or luxurious and voluptuous. . T fc was no novice that shaped the classic cbairs, arranged the ample draperies, sank a frame less pierglass, placed bu^t and bronze on the grotesquely-carved mantelshelf, and filled up the niches bere and there with chapte ornaments and foreign curios, or regularly handled iv their appointed case some choice well-boaud books. On tho wall of this chamber hnng many portraits, bat one alone chained Stanley Woodahorp. "" A noble countsnance, is it not ? "" said a haughty voice. Stanley starled slightly at ths sound, and turning round, beheld the stately mother of his betrothed at his side extending two fingers towards him as a welcome to her house, in this room of which lir had with many misgivings awaited her coming. Lead ing her to a coach, he seatad himself at, a little distance from her aud awaited bar lad j ship's pleasure. After a silence of some moments the lady of the house haughtily demanded of him : ""Am I to understand, \>ir, that what my son says of your pretension to the hand of ray daughter is correct 1 "" Stanley stammered somewhat at the abruptness of the question v.-hich involved sucndelicate overtures, but he was happily rescued from such an awkward predicament by the timely entrance of a young man, who courteously acknowledged the lady's pre sence as he crossed over eagerly to where the visitor sat, and taking his hand in both of his heartily welcomed him by saying, "" Ah, Stanley, back again, dear iellow."" Theu, seeing his anxious look and catching sight of his haughty mother's face, he divined how matters stood ; co whispering softly to Stanley, "" .Edith awaits you in the garden,"" he opened a glass door leading thereto and snowed the not unwilling visitor out. When he was gone the new-comer turned quickly to the frowning lady, who had half risen in remonstrance, and said, ""Now, mother, mine, I have something of importance to say, ! ' at the same time seating himself by ber side. ""If tbs theme is of your friend Stanley — how do you call him I—Woodthorp,1 — Woodthorp, pray be very brief,"" said the lady somewhat sharply. '• Oh, mother, you know he has not only twice saved my life, but he also dragged me, the once worthless Geoffrey, from the very lowest depfcba of despair and degradation, and set him up, caring for him as a brother. Do you forget that, mother ? "" a:->ked ths son earnestly. "" Does my son Geoffrey forget that to the noble earl whose portrait graces yonder wall he is next of kit ? "" demanded the lady with a freezing smile. "" Geoffrey may have forgotten that in tbs degrading past, but it is maicly owisg to his friend Stanley that be remembers it now,"" replied the son with a gay smile. ""He seemed to forget it utterly when he brought our Edith and the stranger together and now encourages she suifc,"" reproved the lady, bitterly. "" Not so, mother ; Stanley is as well born as we are, for on his mother's side he is allied to the noble house o'c Gordon, whilst his father and Earl Dalhousis claim cousinship,"" said Geoffrey gently. "" Tusb, son, 'tis not on a point o£ lineage I object. Bethink you for a moment of the Duke of Blankbhire and his addresses to our Editb,"" answered she impatiently. ""Well, but, mother, Edith and Stanley love "" "" Pshaw, Geoffrey, is there such a thzag as love? We now not only look for alliances in noble to noble, but for wealth to wealth."" "" Well, I grant you Stanley i 3 not rich, but yet if sister Edith wishes it, let us not be the ones to part two such noble hearts asunder,"" replied Geoffrey, half reieat iug. Not slow to take advantage of thip chaoge in her son, the elderly countpss said, ait f ully : "" When my son succeeds to the earl dom bis rent roll will be such that a score of thousands gh'en to a friend such as your mother acknowledges Mr Stanley Wood thorp to be would not be missed."" Geoffrey pondered deeply over his mother's words, uniil a look of determination took possession of his face, then he sprang up i.\nd said firmly, "" No, mo'oher, it caanoo be. Stanley is not one to accept alms, much less from me to whom he has been such a friend. Interfere not, I pray, between sister Edith and he. Nay, mother, I, as the head of our house, command it,"" added he, hastily seeing his mother beginning to rdrnonsJrate. "" And as I have the best right to my daughter I shall exercise it in a better way than her pridelass brother would like to do,"" replied she, flashing ber haughty looks on Geoff rey, who was now pacing up and down the room in some perturbation. Suddenly he ceased and approached his mother caress ingly, saying wiuningly : "" Dearest mother, you know how I love you. Would you not make this small sacrifice for me ? "" "" Geoffrey, Geoffrey, you know quite well I would; but this— -this is asking too much,"" replied the pcor old lady. "" Suppose I could prove Sianley were rich — quite rich enough to satisfy your most ardent desires, would you still continue to place barriers between my best friend and my only sister ? "" "" 1 would,"" replied she hof ly ; "" for the fellow is a mere boaster."" "" A boaster I "" echoed Geoffrey in a sur prised tone. "" Nothing short of it."" ""In what way 1 "" demanded the son in credulously. "" He assured Editb, in my presence, that he possessed such absurd power over some mighty river of this dismal part of the world that at his command it would cease to flow,"" replied the countess sarcastically. "" Nonsense, mother ! "" laughed Geoffrey. ""Call him; I do not aporehend he will have the hardihood to deny it,"" answered she scornfully, pointing out through the window to a walk in the garden where Stanley was bidding his adieu. ""Never mind; see, be comes,"" interrupted she haughtily. As Stanley re-entered the room, Edith hav iDg disappeared, the lady approached him with her sweetest smile, saying : ""By the way, Mr Woodthorp, what was thn name of that wonderful river away down among tks western wilds you were to take us fio, and over whose turbulent waters yon exert such kingly sway ? "" "" The western canon,"" leplied he simply. Geoffrey wss astounded when his mother turned on him her triumphant looks. "" Oh,"" added she, bidding him adieu ; "" we shall all be delighted to see you par form a nineteenth-century miracle, Mr Wood thorp."" "" Such is partly my purpose here. Could you make it convenient to go there to morrow?"" replied Stanley calmly. "" D alighted, I am sure."" "" Very well, I shall be charmed to drive you there, provided you are prepared to put up with the rough roud and a moonlight drive."" "" Delighted,"" re-echoed the lady, turning her eyes, fp*rkling with malice, on her sob, who had fallen back iv coast.ernation at Stanley's mad avowal. ""Well, what do you tbink of your choico of husband for Edith now ? "" demanded the countess. ""Why— why — unless he can prove hi 3 words,"" replied Geoffrey, getting very red in the face, "" I must certainly alter my"" opinion of him."" ""And if he succeeds, Geoffrey — why, I shall alter mine, and gladly receive him as my son-in-law,"" replied bis mother, sinking down into tho cushions with an air of mock rejdgD&tion.",Fiction

Down, there's a good fellow!' accompanied by a pat from the little outstretched white hand, had the effect of sobering the animal's demonstrative joy; and he lay down, a good, obedient dog, at the foot of her sofa, with his paws stretched out in front, and looking up lovingly into the little pale face. ' May,' said I, coming to her side and speaking in what I am sure must have been a soft deprecating voice, ' instead of finishing the story in the poem, may I tell you one of my own ?' ' Yes, if you like,' she replied. 'A. friend of mine once sincerely loved a most sweet and lovable young girl; when and how lie first came to do so he could not quite tell—he thought it must have been as soon a* evor he saw her. He used sometimes to hope and believe that she secretly lovod him, but at the time I speak of he had nothing to offer, so he felt bound in honour to keep his feelings to himself. Some months afterward* he rectived promotion—he was in the army, this friend of mine—aud, it being then in his power to offer his darling a home, he set oat one day in hope and love, to seek her in her father's house, and learn whether he had been cherishing a precious secret, or nourishing a de'usire fancy. ' Before he was brought face to face with the young lady, ho overheard her, by accident, weeping, as he thought, for the absence ef another lover. He did not know the im pulsive little heart was merely giving way to childlike tears for the loss of a favourite, but mistook them for the expression of woman's sorrow. It, made him cold, neglectful, and perhaps defiant; it made him avoid the society he loved best in the world, and, if his mistake had not suddenly and unexpectedly been revealed to him, there is no saying what the consequences might not have been. ' As soon as he had in any way got over the discovery of his ridiculous position, and had ! the opportunity offered him for speaking to her, he found his way to his darling's side ; he told her how forjmonths he had lived in the hope of one day calling her his own, and he a kid her for the swtet a aurance that his love was not offered in vain.' As I proceeded with my veiled confession, the downcast lids and mantling blushes told me I was understood ; and when I had come to the end a most sweet though timid and tremendous smile encouraged me to bend down lower, and to whisper— ' Speak, May, it is really so ? Do you love me as I have sometimes dared to hope you did ?' For a moment nothing was to be heard. Then, faint and soft as the evening breeze, and welcome as the first opening llower in spring, came a gentle sound the faintest intimation of the letter "" s "" —which I inter pretated as the termination to a short word that holds iu its meaning so much. For the next —I connot say how long—no body need expect to know anything of what happened; for I am not going to tell; I would not even if I cjuld. Sutike it to say, we were fully and entirely happy, and 1 leave particulars to the imagination of true lovers iu general. ' May,' I said, at length, ' you will keep my secret, won't you ?

An hour or two later I sought Mr Hilyard in his study, and found his consent to our engagement not difficult to obtain. Unlike most parents of the present day, his desire was for his daughter's happiness, not to dis pose of them in the best market; and he knew enough of my family and personal ante cedents from his brother, at whose house I had first met May, to believe that he was per fectly safe in committing her into my hands. He sent ior Mrs. Hilyard, and she, too, gave her ready consent; aud I sat down to dinner that day with the proud consciousness of being one of the family. A neighbouring magistrate had dropped in, go our new relations were not yet opeuly acknowledged j but, lute iu the evening, when we had all wishtd each other good-night, and I had gone out on the terrace as mual, my future sister-in-law, Blanche, crept down stairs again, and, guided by the spark of my cigar, came sottly to my side. • O Captain Graham, I am so glad it is all ri»ht at last between you and May! I was so uncomfortable about it j for you must know that I h*cl heard of you before I saw you. May aud I have no secrets from each other, and I guessed what you had come for; and then seeing you so cold and distant, and May getting so low-spirited, I could not make it out. I longed to see the misunderstanding, whatever it was, cleared away and all made right; but ot course I couid do nothing. Now she has told me all about your mistake. Ye?, don't be frightened ! lam not going to betray you, though I really think it is too good a joke to be lost. I can only siy lam very sorry for the way I must have helped it oil that first evening.

She had discovered, too, that she could walk a little, but thia she was not permitted to do without the assistance of ft Strong round her slight figure, »nd very often I forbade her trying it at all, and forcibly carried her from place to place—so sweet was it to exercise my new right to take care of her. We spent that first happy day almost entirely alone, May and I—now in the morn ing room, now in some part of the garden, where there were abundant provisions made f'>r the unnisturbed retreat, of lovers. I carried her to the arbour where I had first overheard her and Blanche conversing, and we 'alk""d over every thing in the happy con fidence of mutual love. ' Mary,' I said at length, who is 'C.

In the mouth of January, 1809, some few others and myself succeeded in resuscitating the Institute, after a trance of a year’s duration. The fees of membership were reduced to such a rate as we hoped would render the Institute popular ; and, though at that time it was saddled with con siderable debt, the Committee have succeeded in meeting all Its liabilities ; they have furnished the hall with seats, and purchased more books than the members’ subscriptions would pay for. At that time I was sanguine enough to believe that in this age of great events and great dis coveries the youth of Blenheim would have taken advantage of the facilities such an institu tion affords to learn something of the history of the world’s progress—not merely the history of the past, but the daily history of that world which lives and has its being around and beyond the shores of New Zealand. The pursuits of business or pleasure have, however, proved more attractive than knowledge, and the hall of the Institute, instead of being occupied as a class room, was closed during the greater part of the year. The demand for new books, especially light literature, being far beyond the amount sub scribed by members, induced the Committee to let the Institute to the Building Society, who met twice a month. During the last few weeks they have also entered into engagements with the Society of Rechabites and the Foresters, each society requiring the use of the building twice during the month; the rent has been advanced by the two Societies last named, for the purpose of erecting a porch—an improve ment long required—the completion of which has added very materially to the comfort and convenience of members. In consequence of these new arrangements some irregularity has unavoidably taken place in opening the Library for the exchange of books, and it is to exonerate the Committee from any blame that I have troubled you with this letter; at the same time I wish to assure those members who have been inconvenienced that the Library will be opened at regular and fixed intervals as early as possible, and I trust that the improvement of the building, and the increased means at the disposal of the Com mittee, will be a sufficient apology to those who have suffered any little annoyance from not get ting their books so regular as heretofore. As soon as the final arrangements are complete, the Library evening will be duly advertised; at the same time our printed catalogues are ready for circulation, and I hope our Winter evening readings will be resumed.-—I am, &c., Chaki.es J. Eae, Honorary Secretary and Librarian.",LetterToEditor

"" To remember what?"" said Mr Meredith with a hopeless expression of insanity upon his countenance. Kate Meredith dropped both hands de spairingly at her sides. ""Charlie!"" she exclaimed, ""you don't mean to say that you have forgotten al ready ?"" "" My dear,"" said Mr Meredith, fumbling in the depths of his overcoat pocket for a missing glove, ""I maynot have forgotten— but I don't exactly remember."" "" The oysters !"" suggested his wife. "" Oh, yea, the oyster,"" said Meredith. "" And the two ounces of double zephyr scarlet wool."" "" Exactly."" "" And the depot hack to bo waiting at two o'clock for your cousin from Philadelphia."" "" She is coming to-day, 1 declare to good ness !"" he ejaculated. "" And a dozen Havana oranges for dessert, and two pounds of white grapes and some of those delicious little Naples biscuits and mac caronns and—oh let them send up a girl from St. Clair's."" "" A—which ?"" "" A girl, you ijoose. A girl for general housework. Phoebe went home this morning with faceache, and I can't be left alone with company coming and all. Mind she's a good cook and understands waiting at table."" And Mr Meredith rushed off to catch the 9.30 express, with a kaleidoscopic confusion of grapes, zephyr wool, grapes, hacks, oysters and servant maids careering through his brain, which boded ill for Mrs Meredith's domestic plans. While that lady, clasping both hands over her head in a sort of tragic despair, rushed down into the kitchen, where a very good looking young man of two or three aud twenty was on his knees in front of the range trying to coax a most unwilling fire to burn. "" Well ?"" said he. "" Tom,"" cried she hysterically, ""can you make a lobster salad ?"" "" Like a book,"" said Tom. "" And coffee !"" "" I learned in Paris."" ""Good. And I can make buttermilk biscuit—and betwen us wo can get up a de cent lunch for a young lady from Philadel phia. As for dinner—"" "" Well ?"" again remarked the young man with the soot-besmudgod nose. "" Providence must provide,"" sighed the matron. "" There's an old chintz-colored rooster in the barn-yard. If I could catch him I'd have a chicken stew."" ""Tom, did you ever make a chicken stew ?"" "" No."" "" Then you don't know what you are talk ing about,"" said the lady, with some asperity. ""Yes, I do, too. Onions, potatoes, colcry, pearl barley, with a pinch of salt—"" ""Nonsense!"" interposed Mrs Meredith. "" Go pick that lobster out of its shell, and leave off romancing. You aro a deal better at poetry and newspaper sketches than you are in a kitchen, though, to be sure,"" with a twinge of conscience, ""goodness knows what 1 should do without you just at tins par ticular emergency, you dear old darling,"" The lobster was only half picked out of its shell, thobuttermilk biscuit wasstill unmixed, and Mrs Meredith, with pocket-handkerchief tied around her pretty brown hair was dust ing the little drawing-room, when there came a ring at tho door in a most unceremonious manner. "" Who is there ?"" she demanded in a high contralto. "" Does Mrs Meredith live hero ?"" retorted a woman's voice. And at tho same instant the young matron caught sight of a neat black a lilack alpaca dress, and a shawl of the plainest Highland plaid. '• lis the new girl, thank providence,"" said Mrs Meredith, as she ran down tho stairs, thanking honest Charlie in her heart for his Unexpected promptitude. ""Come in,"" said she, opening the door wide, "" I am so glad you are punctual, my good girl. From St. Clair's Intelligence Bureau, I suppose. No, don't take off your things up here ; the servant's room is below stairs ; you may as well come directly down to the kitchen."" She led the way down, followed by the new girl, whose countenance bore a rather bewildered expression. "" What is your name ?"" she asked patro nisingly. ""My name? Oh, it's Martha,"" replied the stranger, in some confusion. Martha?"" critically repeated Mrs Mere dith. What an ugly name ! I think I shall call you Pattie. Have you good references?"" "" I—believe so."" "" I think, said Mrs Meredith, surveying her from tip to toe, ""you are a little over dressed for your situation Pattie ; but, of course, you have some plainer clothes in your trunk, when it comes."" The stranger lifted a pair of grave blue eyes to the tall form girdod round with a towel, who was vigorously wrestling with the claws of a stupendous lobster at the table beyond. "" Do you keep a man cook ?"" asked the girl. Mrs Meredith drew herself up. ""Certainly not. This is my brother, Mr Selwyn, who is kindly assisting me to make a salad. ""But he is not doing it right. He will never get the meat out of the shell in that way. Let me show you, Mr Selwyn."" And with deft fingers she loosened the luscious white fibre from the scarlet shell in a manner that made Mr Selwyn cry "" Bravo!"" ""And now, Pattie, I will show you where things are, and leave you to get up as nice a lunch as you can for 2.30 o'clock ; we are ex pecting my husband's cousin from Phila delphia. 1 want everything in perfect order."" "" I will finish the salad,"" said Tom, who had secretly been observing the pretty face and trim figure of the new domestic, "" now that I have commenced it. But you need not look perturbed, Pattie, if that is your name. I will be careful not to get in your way. And you ask my sister if I am not a handy sort of fellow around the kitchen."" Kate shook her head surreptitiously at Tom behind the screen, but he resolutely affected not to perceive the warning gesture. Half an hour afterwards he came up to the dining-room, where Mrs Meredith was arrang ing her best lilac and gold china. "" Kate, she is a jewel. A gem of the first water ! Depend upon it, she has not always worked in the kitchen. I quoted Shakespeare, apropos of something or other, I do not re member what, and she recognised the grand old words at once—her eyes brightened, and you should have seen thecolor come into her cheeks."" ""Quoting Shakespeare toa common kitchen girl!"" cried Mrs Meredith in amazement. ""But I tell you she is not a common kitchen girl."" "" 1 don't believe in high life below stairs,"" said his sister disdainfully. The lunch came up at 2.30 in perfect order, but no coiißin from Philadelphia arrived, no hack rolled up to the door. ""How provoking!"" said Kate. ""Miss Meredith must have missed some connecting train. Charlie will be so vexed. But, how ever, I do not so much mind company coming in at any time, now that 1 have got an ex cellent girl."" The dinner of delicately roasted quails and a ring at the door of the door of the window rabbit fricassee, with a dessert of custard and jelly was served at precisely 7 o'clock, at which hour Mr Meredith bounced in, hot and flushed with the haste he had made. "" Where is she ?"" "" Where is who ?"" cried Kate. "" My cousin from Philadelphia."" ""Oh ! She has not come."" "" Not come ?"" ""No."" Mr Meredith drew a sigh of mingled regret and relief. •'Then, after all, it is not so very unlucky,"" said he. "" What is not so unlucky ? Mr dear Charles, you are expressing yourself alto gether in riddles."" "" That I forgot all about the oysters and the zepher wool, and the servant girl."" ""Forgot."" "" Yes—forgot. Isn't that plain English?"" "" But you did not forget,"" remonstrated Mrs Meredith. "" You sent her. She's here now in the kitchen."" Mr Meredith started. "" I have sent no one. Never thought of the girl from that moment to this. I give you my word and honor."" "" Then who did send her ?"" ejaculated his wife, slowly. "" Ring the bell. Let us have her up. Who knows but she is one of those confidence women, with an eye to the forks and spoons."" As he spoke he jerked the bell-cord with some energy. In a minute or so the new girl came up curtesying. Mr Meredith uttered an exclamation of amazement. "" Why, it is Martha Meredith !"" shouted he. ""Itis my cousin from Philadelphia."" And he clasped her in his arms with a shower of kisses which made honest Tom's hair stand on end. ""1 wish she was my cousin from Phila delphia,"" muttered he in a stage whisper, aside. Kate turned as scarlet as a pepper-pod. "" Oh, good gracious !"" she cried, clasping her little hands nervously, "" and I took her for a cook."" "" And I am a cook when occasion requires, Cousin Kate,"" said pretty Martha Meredith, making her peace with a kiss. ""Do not be vexed at me for humoring the joke ; indeed I could not help it. And I will show you how to make meringues glaces and the Neapolitan cremes to-morrow."" And they all sat happily down together to the roast quails and fricassed rabbits. And Kate and Martha went to the International Bureau on the morrow, established a Milesian damsel in the kitchen, who was not at all in congruous in her surroundings, and Tom, leaning over his sister's shoulder, whispered waggishly— "" Didn't T tell you she was a gem of the first water.""",Fiction

Faerie Queene. Miss Leavenworth, who appeared to have lingered from a vague terror of of everything and everybody^ in the house, not under her immediate ob servation, shrank from my side the mo ment she found we were comparatively alone, and retiring to a distant corner, gave herself up to grief. Turning my attention, therefore, in the direction of Mr Gryce, I found that per son busily engaged in counting his own fingers with a troubled expres sion upon his countenance, which may, or may not have been the re sult of that arduous employment. But at my approach, satisfied perhaps that he possessed no more than the requisite number, he dropped his hands and , greeted me with a faint smile that was, < considering all things, too suggestive to be pleasant. ' Well,' said I, taking my stand be fore him, ' I cannot blame you. You had a right to do as you thought best, but how hacl you the heart 1 Was she not sufficiently compromised without you bringing out that wretched hand kerchief, ""which she may or may not have dropped in that room, but whose presence there, soiled though it was with pistol grease, is certainly no proof that she herself was connected with this murder 1 ?' 'Mr Raymond,' said he, 'I have been detailed as police officer and de tective to look after this case;, and I propose to do it.' < Of course,' I hastened to reply,' T am the last man to wish you to shirk your duty ; but you cannot have the temerity to declare that this young and tender creature can by any possibility be considered as at all likely to be im plicated in a crime so monstrous and unnatural. The mere assertion of an other woman's suspicions on the subject ought not — ' But here Mr Gryce interrupted me. ' You talk when your attention should bo directed to more important matters. That other woman, as you are pleased to designate the fairest ornament of New York society, sits over there in tear. ; go and comfort her.' Looking at him in amazement, I hesitated ?o comply, but. seeing he was in earnest, crossed to Mary Leaven worth and sat down by her side. She was weeping, but in a slow, unconscious way, as if grief had been mastered by fear. The fear was too undisguised and the grief too natural for me to dbubt the genuineness of either. .'Miss Leavenworth,' said I, 'any attempt at consolation on the part of a stranger, must seem at a time like this the most bitter of mockeries, but do try and consider that circumstantial evi dence is not always absolute proof.' Starting like one caught back from the verge of a precipice just as destruc tion seemed inevitable, she turned her eyes upon me with a slow, comprehens sive gaze wonderful to see in orbs so tender and womanly. 'No,' murmured she, 'circumstantial evidence is not absolute proof, but Eleanore does not know this. She is so intense ; she cannot see but one thing at a time. She has been running her head into a noose, and oh, — ' Pausing she clutched my arm with a passionate grasp, « Do you think there is any danger 1 ? Will they — ' She could not go on. 'Miss Leavenworth,' whispered 1, with a warning look towards the de tective, ' what do you mean V Like a flash her glance followed mine, an instant change taking place in her bearing. ' Your cousin may be intense,' 1 went on as if nothing had occurred, * but I do not know to what you refer when you say that she has been run ning her head into a noose.' i ' I mean this,' returned she firmly, ' that wittingly or unwittingly she has sc parried and met the questions which liave been put to her in this room that anyone listening to her would give her the credit of knowing more than she ought to of this horrible affair. She acts,' Mary whispered, but not so low but that every word could be distinctly heard in all quarters of the room, 'as if she were anxious to conceal some- j thing. But she is not ; lam sure she is not. Eleanore and I are not good friends, but all the world could never make me believe that she has any more knowledge of this murder than I have. Won't somebody tell her then— won't you — that her manner is a mistake, that it is calculated to arouse suspicion, that it has already done so 1 Ancl, oh, tell her from me,' she went on, her voice sinking to a low whisper now, ' what you have just said, that circum stantial evidence is not always absolute proof.' I surveyed her with great astonish ment. What an actress this woman was ! 'You request me to tell her this,' said I ; ' wouldn't it be better for you to speak to her yourself V 'Eleanore ancl I hold little or no confidential communication,' replied she. I could easily believe that, and yet I was puzzled. Indeed there was some thing incomprehensible in her whole manner. Not knowing what else to say, I remarked, ' That is unfortunate. She ought tc be told that the straight- j forward course is the best by all means.' Mary Leavenworth only wept, ' Oh, why has this awful trouble come to me who have always been so happy be fore !' ' Perhaps for the very reason that you have always been so happy.' i ' It was not enough that dear uncle , should die in this horrible manner ; but she, my own cousin, hacl to — ' I touched her arm, and the action seemed to recall her to herself. Stop ping short sho bit her lip. I ' Miss Leavenworth,' I whispered, j ' you should hope for the best. Be sides, I honestly believe that you are disturbing yourself unnecessarily. If nothing fresh transpires, a mere pre varication or so of your cousin's will not suffice to injure her.' I said this to see if she had any reason to doubt the future. I was amply rewarded. ' Anything fresh 1 How could there be anything fresh when she is perfectly innocent V Suddenly a thought seemed to strike her. 'Mr Raymond,' said she, wheeling round in her seat till her lovely per fumed wrapper brushed my knee, ' why didn't they ask me more questions'? I could have told them Eleanore never left her room last night.' ' You could V What was Ito think of this woman 1 ' Yes * my room is nearer the head of the stairs than hers. To have gone down she would have been obliged to pass my door. I should have heard her, don't you see ? Ah, was that all 1 ' That does not follow,' I answered sadly. Can you give no other reason V 'I would say whatever was neces sary,' she whispered. I started back. Yes, this woman would He now to save her cousin, hud lied during the inquest; but then I felt grateful, and now I was simply horrified. "" Miss Leavenworth,' said I, ' nothing can justify one in violating the dictates of one's own conscience, not even the safety of one we do not altogether love.' 'No V returned she ; and her lip took a tremulous curve, the lovely bosom heaved, and she softly looked away. If Eleanore's beauty had made one jot less of an impression on my fancy, i or her frightful situation awakened one iota less of anxiety in my breast, I should have been a lost man from that moment. ' I did not mean to do anything very wrong,' murmured she ; 'do not think too badly of me.' ' No, no,' said I ; and there is not a man living who would not have said the same in my place, What more might have passed be tween us on this subject I cannot say, for just then the door opened and a man entered, whom I recognised as the on 3 who had followed Eleanore Lea venworth out a short time before. •Mr Gryce,' said he, pausing just inside the door, * a word if you please.' The detective nodded, but did not hasten toward him ; instead of that, walked deliberately away to the other end of the room, where he lifted the lid of an inkstand he saw there, mut tered some unintelligible words into it, and speedily shut it again. Immediately tlie uncanny fancy seized me that if I could leap to the inkstand, open it and peer in, I should surprise and capture the bit of con fidence he had intrusted to it. But I restrained my foolish impulse, and con tented myself with noting the subdued look of respect with which the gaunt subordinate watched the approach of his superior. 'Well/ inquired the latter as he reached him, ' what now V The man shrugged his shoulders and drew his principal through the open door. Once in the hall their voices sank to a whisper, and as their backs only were visible T turned to look at my companion. She was pale, but composed. ' Has he come from Eleanore V • 'I do not know ; I fear so. Miss Leavenworth,' said I, 'can it be pos sible that your cousin has anything in her possession that she desires to con ceal f ' Then you think she is trying to conceal something V 'I do not say so. But there was considerable talk about a paper — ' ' They will never find any paper or anything else suspicious in Eleanore's possession,' interrupted she. 'lii the first place, there was no paper of im portance enough ' — I saw Mr Gryce's form suddenly stiffen — ' for anyone to think of concealment. Don't I know ""■ Was I not my uncle's confidant V 4 1 clo not suppose there was,' sug gested I, *as far as your knowledge goes. But could she not have been acquainted with something — ' She drew back coldly. { Thero was nothing to be acquainted with, Mr Ray mond. We lived the most methodical and domestic of lives. I cannot understand for my part why so much should be niacin out of this. My uncle undoubtedly came to his death by the hand of some in tended burglar. That nothing was stolen from the house, is no proof that a burglar never entered it. xAs for the doors ancl windows being locked, will you take the word of an Irish servant as infallible upon such a point as that 1 ? I cannot. I believe the assassin to be one of a gang who make their living by breaking into houses, and if you cannot honestly agree with mc, clo try ancl consider such an explanation as possible, if not for the sake of the family credit, why then — ' and she timed her face with all its fair beauty upon mine, ayes, cheeks, mouth all so exquisite ancl winsome — 'why then for mine.' Instantly Mr Gryce turned toward us. 'Mr Raymond, will you be kind enough to step this way V Glad to escape from my present position, I hastily obeyed. 'What has happened' 1 ' I inquired. ' Wo propose to take you into our confidence,' murmured Mr Gryce easily. 'Excuse mo, Mr Raymond, Mr Fobbs.' 1 bowed to the man I saw before me, and stood uneasily waiting. Anxious as I was to know what we really had to fear I still intuitively shrank from any communication witli one whom I looked upon as a spy. ' A matter of some importance,' con tinued Mr Gryce, ' it is not necessary for me to remind you that it is in con fidence, is it V 'No.' ' I thought not. Mr Fobbs, you may proceed.' Instantly the whole appearance of tho man Fobbs changed. Assuming an expression of lofty importance, he laid his large hand outspread upon his heart and commenced. ' Detailed by Mr Gryce to watch the movements of Miss Eleanore leaven worth, I left this room upon her de parture from it, and followed her and the two servants who conducted her, upstairs to her own apartment. Once there — ' Mr Gryce interrupted him. ' Once there 1 where V ' Her own room, sir.' ' Where situated V 1 At the head of the stairs.' ' That is not her room. Go on.' ' Not her room 1 then, ib was tlie fire she was after,' cried he, clapping him self on the knee. 'The fire? < Excuse me, I am ahead of my story. She did not appear to notice me much, though I Avas right behind her. It was not until she had reached the door of this room — which was not her room,' he interpolated dramatically, 'and turned to dismiss her servants, that she seemed conscious that she was followed. Looking at me then with an air of great dignity, quickly eclipsed, however, by an expression of patient endurance, she walked in, leaving the door open behind her in a courteous way that I cannot sufficiently com mend.' I could not help frowning. Honest as the man appeared, this was evidently anything but a sore subject with him. Observing me frown, he softened his manner. ' Not seeing any other way of keep ing her under my eye, and thus per forming my duty creditably, except by entering the room, I followed her in and took a seat in a remote corner. She flashed one look at me as I did so, and commenced pacing the room in a restless kind of way I'm not altogether unused to. At last she stopped abruptly, right in the middle of the room. "" Get me a glass of water,"" she gasped ; "" I'm faint again — quick ! on the stand in the corner."" Now in order to get that glass of water it was necessary for me to pass behind a dress ing mirror that reached almost to the ceiling, and I naturally hesitated. But she turned and looked at me, and — Well, gentlemen, I think either of you would have hastened to do what she asked ; or at least — ' with a doubtful look at Mr Gryce — 'have given your two ears for the privilege, | even if you didn't succumb to the temptation.' ' Well, well !' exclaimed Mr Gryce impatiently. 'I am going on,' said he. ; I stopped out of sight, then, for. a moment, but it seemed long enough for her purpose, for when I emerged glass in hand, she was kneeling at the grate full five feet from the spot where she had been standing, and was fumbling with the waist of her dress in a way that con vinced me she had something concealed there, which she was anxious to dis pose of. I eyed her pretty closely as I handed her the glass of water, but she was gazing into the grate with a look on her face that I don't remember ever seeing their before, and didn't appear to notice. Drinking barely a drop, she gave it back, and in another moment was holding out her hands over the fire. "" 0, I am so cold,"" murmured she, ""so cold,"" and I verily believe she was. At any rate sho shivered most naturally. But there were a few dying embers in the grate, and when 1 saw her thrust her hand again into the folds of her dress, I became distrustful of her in tentions, and drawing a step nearer, looked over her shoulder, when I dis tinctly saw her drop something into the grate that clinked as it fell. Suspect ing what it was I was about to inter fere, when she sprang to her feet, seized the scuttle of coal that was upon the hearth, and with one move entpted the whole upon the flying embers. "" I want a fire,"" she cried, ""a fire."" ""That is hardly the way to make one,"" I re turned, carefully taking the coal out with my hands, piece by piece, and put ting it back into the scuttle, till — ' ' Till what 1 ?' I asked seeing him and Mr Gryce exchanging a hurried look. 'Till I found this,' opening his largo hand and showing me a broken handled key.",Fiction

Placards were issued, informing the orthodox Russians that the property of the Jews had been given over to them, and that they might take it. The Government did not deny the outrageous notification. The orthodox rose. The mili tary being called out, presented themselves at the scene of the massacre, but only to look on,, their 'criminal sympathy with the mob only tending to encourage the cruel excesses."" "" Didst thou say massacre 1 "" asked Kloss tock, looking aghast at the Italian. "" I said massacre. • Bat it was worse than massacre, my father ; 25 good worifen, oar dear sisters, were violated, 10 dying in con* sequence."" 11 Holy Father I "" exclaimed the Rabbi. 11 At the house of one MordeoaiWienarsld, the mob, disappointed of plunder, caughtj up bis child mA buried, ft tough the wto< dow. The infant fell dead at the leet of a company of Cossacks, but they moved neither to take it upnor to arrest the murderers. Two thousand of our brethren are houseless ; six have gone to their long rest, many are grievously wounded, and the Community has been plundered of property of the value of 40,000 English pounds."" "" Thou strikest me dumb, Ferrari ! "" said the host. "" What dost thou advise 1 "" "" Nay, calm yourself,"" said Losinski ; "" this is not the first rising against our brethren and while all Russia has suffered much in this way, do not forget that Czarovna has been free from trouble. We must not seem to know of this terrible news; we must show no fear ; we must not let it change our manner towards our neighbours ; General Poltava is still with us, and hi 3 officers are kind and considerate."" ""Do not be deceived,"" said Ferrari; ""to morrow, perhaps to-night, your new Governor will arrive at the palace ; I passed him on the way ; he was travelling incognito. By this time General Poltava is under arrest."" Klosstock leaned back in his chair and groaned. "" I almost hate myself for being the bearer of such ill-tidings,"" said Ferrari ; ""it is the bolt from the blue. I found you steeped in the happiness of virtue, good-feeling, and sweet content; I am a moral earthquake to your household bliss. But it is in one's happiest hours that Fate strikes us down."" ""Let us pray,"" said the Eabbi. Nathan Klosstock fell upon his knees in a paroxysm of grief. Ferrari bowed his head, mumbling to himself that he would rather cut the throat of the servant Negrusz before he had time to do him at least a mischief. The Rabbi offered up an eloquent'appeal to the God of their fathers, recalling the many favours He had accorded to His chosen people, and especially the blessings He had vouch safed to Czarovna, bewailing the persecutions which His people suffered round about them, and more especially asking for the protection of this hcuse of Klosstock, and of His servant Anna, the light of her father's old age, and soon with His favour to be a wife unto the humble petitioner, and so on— a prayer of faith and hope and humility, to which Klos stock said ""Amen,"" and Ferrari ""So mote it be."" Then there was a dead pause, and the three men stood up and listened, as if they expected an answer to the Rabbi's prayer in the shape of some good omen or token of peace. But all was still as death, except for the howl of some restless clog in a distant street. The moon had risen and was pouring its beams into her chamber as Anna set down her lamp upon a quaint old chest by the window. She sat right in the midst of the lunar radiance and thought how beautiful it was, how lovely was life— her life— what rich blessings God had lavished upon. There was not a single tremor of fear in her hearb. If trouble was coming to Czarovna, she and those she most loved would be able to leave it. It would have been too much to have ex pected her to think of any others at that momeut besides her father and her lover. Nor could she realise the bitterness of a per secution which she had not felt, and which Czarovna had not known in her time ; and while the Eabbi had spoken of these things, he had been jealous not to over-shadow Anna's happiness with tales of horrors, the recitation of which, while they might cast a shadow upon her thoughts, could serve no useful purpose. For she was born with sen sibilities and a sympathetic nature, and would find in life itself, as she grew older, quite enough that was sad, without lavishing her sympathies upon sorrows and troubles she could neither influence, amend, nor con trol. Anna did not dream of the shadowy form that crept out of the moonlight, crouching beneath her window, as she closed the shutters and betook herself to her prayers. Neither did the Rabbi, nor the guest, nor good old Father Klosstock. For the three men now lighted fresh pipes, and gathered about the stove to be free and confidential in their conversation, Anna having retired. ""This new Governor,"" said Ferrari, ""is General Petronovitch, a man of a cruel dis position, who hates our chosen people, and aids and abets their persecution. Nay, dear host, my good friend, be not impatient with mo. I know what I say ; know more than I dare communicate to you ; know more than some might say I ought ; more I hope than is good for such as Petronovitch."" "" I have never asked thee, Ferrari, whence thou comest, or whither thou goest ; but I trust to thy love and discretion not to com promise this household with anything that can be called political."" "" Your trust is well placed ; lam here for the lasb time. Czarovna will see me no more ; nor, indeed, will Russia, after I leave her accursed soil on this last journey. In deed, but for the love I bear you and your daughter I should have not been here to say farewell ; for I passed a long distance out of the way I was going to bring you the warn ing which the Rabbi Losinski has haply re ceived 'before me. His well ; yon might otherwise have thought less of what I had"" to tell you."" "" If you are compromised in the eyes of the Government, Andrea Ferrari, it is hardly kind to have made this your chief house of call in Southern Eussia,' said the Rabbi. "" I have -had no reason to believe that I was suspected until I left St. Petersburg this time, intending to go to Paris; but some sudden knowledge of the change of Govern ment here and the departure of a certain man from the capital for Elizabetbgrad and Czarovna, forced me, as I said before, out of the love I bear this household, and to make my way hither."" While he was speaking, the man who had crept out of the moonlight entered the old house by a side door in the courtyard, which was opened to him by an inmate; and at the same time there emerged from an archway in the street at the entrance to the Ghetto a file of soldiers, and a waggon came rumbling along the thoroughfare, awakening the otherwise quiet echoes"" of the night. ""What is the noise outside '?"" asked Fer rari, feeling the knife, which he always carried handy in a belt on his hip. •' Some late carrier from the country,"" said Klosstook. ""You seem muoh disturbed,"" remarked the Rabbi. "" I had a bad dream last night ; , I thought I was sitting here among you, and that sud denly there started up behind the stove a man, who said, 'Andrea Ferrari, thou art my prisoner.' The noise outside struck me curiously as if ifc were the prologue to my captivity."" "" Hast thou been drinking Andrea 1 "" the old man asked. "" Nay; lamin my soberest senses ; a little over anxious for thy welfare perhaps ; for know this— Governor General Petronovitch is a sensualist, and a tyrant ; he is believed to have instigated the rising against our chosen' people at Elizabethgrad, and your friend Poltava's withdrawal from the province is not promotion, it is disgrace; he is even suspected of sympathy with the Nihilistic propaganda."" "" God forbid ! "" exclaimed Klosstock. "" Moreover, thy new servant, Amos Negrusz, is a Government spy "" "" And he arrests thee, Andrea Ferrari, as a traitor!"" said a voice, which seemed to come from the earth, as the thiee men started to their feet and the servant emerged from a dark corner of the room, covering Ferrari with the shining barrel of a revolver, while at the same time another person ap peared from the doorway whence Anna had retired, and a long knocking was heard at the front door of the house. "" Do thou open thy door to the police?"" said Negrusz. Ferrari had stood perfectly still, his heart beating wildly, but hand and head ready for the slightest chance of escape. The arrogant act of bhe servant in ordering the master to open his own door gave Ferrari the oppor tunity. It was only for a second that Negrusz was off his guard, but in that second Ferrari, with the agility of a cat, was upon him, his knife in his throat, the, pistol wrested from him, and the next moment the little Italian had disappeared through the open doorway in the rear. A scene o""f confusion followed: hurried orders of military men, the screams of women, and presently the report of firearms in the principal street of the Ghetto. (To he continued,.')",Fiction

He left some misgiving as to how that gentleman would receive the intelligence, which no doubt had been imparted to him by Mr White. His doubts were at once set at rest when he looked at Obadiah. He was pacing up and down the room as if in great agitation, and when he turned his face to Hector it was perfectly diabolical in expression. "" A nice thing this, Mr Macinnis,"" ho said, his shrill harsh voico considerably acidulated. ""You call yourself my friend. Indeed ! You heard me speak of this girl to-day, yet you never said a word, you hypocrite. And all this, after ' -what I have ddne for you, you ungrate ful wretch. Who put you in at the head of the poll ?

"" No, indeed ; there is no comparison,"" said Hector, haughtily. ""No comparison,"" said Obadiah, his voice rising to a screaming falsetto ; ""no comparison. 0, no ! your high mighti ness. What have you done to gain her ? And what have I done ? I have done what, if you heard it, would make your face pale, would make you shrink with horror. I have schemed and planned and sinned to obtain her — I, who was thought to be so religious and gcod. And, now that I thought the path was smooth, and the most dangerous opponent out of the xoad, you start up and cut the ground from under my feet. Hector Mncinnis, you don't know me; if you did you would be afraid to do what you have done. You will never marry that girl."" "" Pooh ! pooh !"" said Hector ; ""this is the height of folly on your part, ' Obadiah. Bertha would never have you if there were only you two in f he world."" ""Wouldn't she?""' said Obadiah, com ing close up to Hector, and thrusting his ugly face close to his. M You don't know half what I do. Do you think I ■ have schemed in the dark. Just let me tell you something that will open your eyes, clever as you imagino yourself. You think that Mr Whito is a rich man. Well, I tell you he's nothing of the kind. After he gave up mining he entered into speculation as a merchant, and as he knew nothing about the business, of course he made most miserable mistakes, 1 and if he's not ruined he's very near it. I tell you I found this out, and bought np mortgages and bills of his in order to effectually have him in my power. And then it only needed a little pressure to ' bring him down on his knees and to make him give me that proud girl. Why is he giting her to you ? Because he thinks you will aid him, and take him out ©f the mire into which he has fallen. He *'^?ould have done the same thing to me, J^bnly you, enrse you, came in and spoiled ' Hector smiled.

Come to par ticulars,"" said Hector. Obadiah felt as if he could tear this cool, mocking man to pieces. He knew too well that whatever were his suspi cions he had nothing positive to bring forward. ""You know nothing,"" said Hector, contemptuously, <( and as you have chosen to take up the other side and become my enemy, take it. I can be happy without you.""

At times the wildest schemes entered his head, only to be dis misbed when the large fund of common sense of which he was possessed came to his rescue. While careering madly along the side path he almost knocked down a bent and haggard woman, dresbed in rags, who was walking along it. He glanced at hor. Was it possible ? Yes, there was Mrs. Macinnis. Prudence M'Cruath, the woman who had met Jack at the Parlia ment House, although he failed to recog nise her.

Even then, if Dr Hutton, with all his prac tised acumen, had mixed one grain of the knowledge of men, he might have done what he liked with Sir Cradock, and re established the dynasty; unless, indeed, young Cradock were bent upon going through with everything. But the only mode Rufus Hutton knew of meeting the world was an tagonism. ‘Yes, sir, you may think nothing of t. But I have hunted a thing for three hundred leagues, and got it through the biggest liars that ever stole a white man’s breeches.’ ‘Thank you, Dr Hutton/ said Cradock, diverting the contest. * And I fear the word you mean applies to me also.’ * Perhaps, young man,’ cried Rufus Hut ton, ‘ you know more Hindustani than I do. ‘ Translate—’ and he poured out a sentence which I dare not try to write down. 1 But, my good fellow, you forget it is we who are stealing yours.’ * I think,’ said Sir Cradock, slowly, and seriously displeased—Good heavens ! to joke about the succession to the Nowelhurst title and lands!— * I think, sir, this can hardly be looked upon as evidence. 1 always confine the issue, sir. As Chairman of the Quarter Sessions, I always confine the issue.’ ‘And so, Sir Cradock, do I, both as judge, and in other ways,’ Rufus laughed at his own bad joke, and expected the others to laugh with him. It made things worse than ever. Sir Cradock was afraid to speak, lest he might say something unseemly to a visitor. The young man saw his opportu nity, and took advantage of it. ‘ Father, I beg you to let me go. You would not wish me, I am sure, to be here ; only you think it my right to be. If you please, I willjwaive that right; I can wholly trust your decision.’. He bowed to his father in cold respect, being hurt at his rapid conviction, to Rufus Hutton with some contempt and a smile at the situation. Then he marched down the long room placidly, and whistled when he was out of it. The next moment he bolted away to his bedroom, and wept there very heavily. * Glorious fellow!’ cried Dr Hutton. ‘ But we don’t at all appreciate him. Requires a man of mind to do that. And now for Mrs O’Gaghan!’ Leaving Sir Cradock this speech to digest, he arose and rang the bell sharply. He felt himself fully invested now with supreme judical authority, and he longed to be at the Irishwoman, who had called him a ‘ red gasson.’ Chapter XVII. Biddy O’Gaghan was hard at work, boiling down herbs and blessing them, drying and bottling cleverly, scraping, and picking the cloves out. She had turned the still-room of the house into her private Ikboratory ; and she saved all the parish and half of the hundred from ‘them pisoners as called themselves doctors.’ Now she was one of those powerful women—common enough, by-the-by —who can work all the better for talking ;""and between her sniffs at the sauce pan-lids, and her tests upon the drying pans, she had learned that something strange was up, and had made fifty guesses about it. Blowing the scum and the pearly beads from a pot of pellitory of the wall (one of her staunch panaceas), she received a command most pre-emptory to present herself in the justice-room. 1 Thin was that the way as they said it, Dick P No sinse nor manners but that! An’ every bit of the blessed while they knowed it for my bilin’-day ! Muckstraw, then, is Bridget O’Gahan no more count than,a pisonin’ doctor P Hould the handle there, Dick. If iver you stirs it the bridth of one on your carroty whiskers from that smut on tue firebar, till such times as you see me again. I’ll down with it arl in your crooked back bilin’, and your chilthers shall disinherit it.’ Leaving Dick rooted in trepidation, for she was now considered a witch, she hurried into her little bedroom; for she had the strongest sense of propriety, and would not ‘ make herself eommou,’ Then she dashed her apron aside, and softened the fire-glow from Her nose, and smoothed the creases of her jet-black hair, which curled in bars like crotchet-work. This last she did with some lubricous staple of her own discovery, applying it with the ball of her thumb. ‘ T'ne hairs of me head,’ as she always called them, were thick of number and strong of fibre, and went zig-zag on their road to her ears, like a string of jockey’s hoiscs shying, or a flight of jack-snipes. Then a final glance at her fungous looking-glass, just to know if she were ail right; the glass gave her back a tine, warm-hearted face, still young in its rapid expression, Irish iu every nne of it, glazed with lies for hatred, and beaming with truth for love. So Biddy gave two or three nods thereat, and knew herself match for fifty cross-examiners, if she could only keep her temper. As she marched up to the table, with her head tiirown back. Her portly shape made the most of, and the front of her strong arms glistening, then dropped a crisp curt sey to Sir Cradock without deigning to notice his visitor, the little doctor's experi ence told him that he had caught a thorough Tartar. Alibis solemn preparations were thrown away upon her, though the biggest Testament in the house lay on the table before him; and a most impressive desk was covered witn pens, and paper, and sealing wax. . Hr Hutton would not yet open his mouth, because he wished to begin augustiy. Mean while Sir Cradock kept waiting for him, till Biddy could wait no longer. Turning her broact back full upon Rufus, who appre ciated the compliment, sHe made auotuer short scrape to her master, aud asked, with an ogle suppressed to a mince— • And wnat wud your honour be pleased to want with tHe poor widow, Bridget O’Gaghan, then ?’ ‘ Bridget, that gentleman. Dr Hutton, has made an extremely important discovery, affecting most neariy my honour aud that of the family. And. now 1 rely upon you, Bridget, as a faithful and valued dependent of ours, to answer without reservation or attempt at equivocation, all the questions he may put to you.’ ‘ Questions, your honour ?’ and Biddy looked stupid iu the cleverest way imagin able. 1 Yes, questions, Bridget O’Gaghan. In quiries, interrogations—ah 1 that quite ex plains what I mean.’ ‘ls it axing any harm, thin, any onda cency of a poor lone widder woman, your honour wua be aither ?’ She took to her brogue as a tower of refuge. Biimgaul races are up to the tactics of rats with a double hole. ‘ Sir Cradock Nowell,’ said Itafus, from the bottom of his chest, ‘ you, 1 believe, are a magistrate for this county of Hants, Vice-Lieutenant, Colonel of Yeomanry, the representative ' of the sovereign. X call upon,, now, in all these, capacities, to to administer the oath to this pervaricating woman.’ The penultimate word rather terrified Bridget, for she never had heard it be fore ; but the last word of all reassured her. , She turned round suddenly on little Rufus, who had jumped from his chair in excitement, and standing by head and shoulders above him, she opened her great eyes down upon him, like the portholes of a frigate. ‘ Faix, then, and I niver seen this young man at all at all. It’s between the arms of the cheer he were, and me never to look so low ]for him! ’Tis the black measles as he’ve tuk, and I’ve seen as bad a case brought through with. The luck o’ the blessed saints in glory! I’ve been bilin’ up for the same. If it’s narse him I can to the toorn of it, I’m intirely at your sarvice. Sir Craduck. I likes to narse a base little chap, sin’ there’s no call to fear for his beauty.’ This last was uttered gently, and quite as a private reflection; but it told more than all the rest. For ever since Dr Hutton had married a woman half his age, he had grown exceedingly sensitive as to his per sonal appearance. By a very great effort he kept silent, but his face was almost black with wrath, as he handed the greac book to Sir Cradock, The magistrate presented it solemnly to Bridget, who took it as patly as if it had been a flat iron. A score of times she had sworn according to what was thought good for her, years ago, in Ireland. At the right moment of dictation, she gave the book a loud smack that required good binding to stand it, and then crossed her self very devoutly, to take the taste away. Of a heretic oath she had little fear, though she would not have told a big lie to her priest. Then she dropped her eyes, and chastened her aspect, as if to overcome by the sense of solemn responsibility. ‘ Bridget O’Geoghegan,’ began the worthy doctor, emphasising slowly every syllable of her name, Jand prepared to write down her replies, ‘you are now upon your solemn oath, to declare the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth. Aud if you fail iu this, remember, you will place your precious soul in the power of the evil one.’ ‘ Amin to that same thin. And more power to yer.’ ‘ Bridget, do you remember the night when your master’s children were born ?’ ‘Sure an’ I do thin. Unless it wur in the mornin’. How wud I help remember ing it P’ ‘ And do you remember the medical gentle man, who was suddenly called in ?’ ‘ And if I wur ten times on my oath, I don’t remimber no gintleman. A bit of a red-haired gosson there was, as wor on the way to be transported.’ ‘ Do you remember his name ?’ ‘ Remimber it P Let me see thin. It wor hardly worth the throuble of forgettin’. Button or Mutton ; no, faix I b’lieve it wor Rubus Rotten.’ ‘ Well, never mind his name— ’ ‘ My faith, and I niver did then, nor the little spalpin ayther. Bub to my heart I was sorry for the dear good, beautifnl lady —glory be to her sowl —along o’ that ignorant, carroty, sprawlin’, ; big-knuckled otnadhawn. Small chance for her to get over it.’ ‘ Silence, woman, how dare you ?’ said Sir Cradock, very angerly. ‘ And I thought it was arl the truth as yer honour said I was to tell.’ Here Biddy looked hurt and amazed. ‘Have the little clerk got it all in black and white ?’ With a sigh for,his incapacity, she peered over the desk at his paper. ‘ Now, Mrs O’Gaghan, no trifling !’ Her master spoke sternly and sharply. Bub Rufus could not speak at all. He was in such a choking passion. * If so be I have said any harm, sir, for the best of us is errowneous, I axes a humble pardon. Iver since I lose my goad husband—aud a better husband there cudn’t be, barrin only the bellises. and I wudn’t deny upon my oath but what I desarved the spout now and thin—’ ‘ Mrs O’Gaghan,’ said Dr. Hutton, trying very hard to look amiable, ‘ do your best for once, I entreat you, to prove yourself, if there is such a thing, “ a respectable Irish' woman.” ’ From that moment the tables were turned. Her temper boiled up like a cauldron. It is quite of a piece with a thing that is all pieces—the genuine Irish nature —that, proud as they are of their country, they cannot bear to be told of their citizen ship. . * Irish, thin, is it ? Irish indade ! Well, and 1 knows I’m Irish. Aud if 1 ain’t, what do 1 care who knows I am ?’ She flung up her head superbly, and great tears ran from her eyes. Rufus Hutton perceived his advantage, and though not at all a mean fellow, he was smarting far too sharply from the many attacks on his vanity, to forgo his sweet revenge. ‘ You remember, then, when the doctor gave you the first-born child, that he made some odd remark, and told you to keep it separate ?’ ‘ And how can a poor Irishwoman remim ber anything at all ?’ ‘ Come, you know very well that you re member tuat. Now, can you deny it f ’ ‘ is it likely you’ll catch me deny anything as is a lie, then, Irish or nob, as you piases rl -bosom-j Still was heaving with the ground swell of her injury. * Well, now, for, the honour of old Ire land, tell us the truth for once. What wore the words he said ?’ ‘ Save me if evir a bit of me can tell. Maynap I might call it to mind, if 1 heer’d them words again.’ ‘ Were they not these—“ Left to right over the shoulder, and a strapping boy ne is ?’ ” ‘ Bedad then, and they might have been.’ ‘ i want to know what they were.’ , How can 1 tell what they were ? 1 only know what they was. ‘ Well, and what was that ?’ ‘ Thim very same words as you’ve said.’ She turned towards the door with a sullen, air, while he looked at Sir Cradock iu triumph. Nevertheless he still wanted her evidence as to the subsequent mistake. He had been, as I said, to the ‘ Jolly Foresters’ and seen the Miss Penny of old; who now as the mother of nine or ten children, was kindly communicative upon all questions of infancy. ‘ So then, Mrs O’Gaghan, with the best intentions in the world, you marked the elder child with a rosette, as I saw on the following day.’ ‘ Thrue for you as the Gospel. And what more wul you have me do ?’ ‘ Nothing. Only take a needle and thread to it j instead of crimping it into the cap.’ Poor Biddy started from where she stood, aud pressed one hand to her heart, ‘ It s the divil himself,” she muttered, ‘as turns me inside out so. And sure that same is the reason he does be so black read.’ -then aloud, with a final rally— ‘ And who say they iver see me take a needle and thread f And if X did, what odds td them ?’ ‘No, that was the very thing you omitted to do, until it was too late. But when you sent to Mrs Toaster tor her large butter scales, what was it you put on each side P’ ’ What was it ? No lining at all. Fair play for the both of them, as I hope to be weighed in purgatory.’ Sir Cradock was looking on, all this while, with the deepest amazement and interest. He had not received any hint beforehand of this confirmative evidence. ‘ And, pray, what was the reason that you wanted to weigh them at all ? You know that it is considered unlucky among nurses to weigh infants/ 1 Why else wud I weigh them, except to see which wur the heaviest < And pray, Bridget, which was the heavier ?’ asked Sir Cradock, almost smil ing. • Mr Cradock, as is now, your honour. I’d swear it on my dying bed. Did you think, then, I’d iver wrong him, the innocents as they was ?’ ‘ And did you weigh them with rosettes on ?’ Eufus Hutton had not finished yet. 1 How could I, and only one got it ?’ * Oh, then, you had fastened it on again. ‘ Do you think they was born with ribbons on ?’ This was poor Biddy’s last rapartee. She lost heart and told everything afterwards. How she had heard that there was some dif ference in the marks of the infants, though what it was she knew not j ustly ; having, like mostlrishwomen, theclearest perception that right and left are only relative terms, and come wrong in the looking-glass, as they do in heraldry. How, when she found the rosette adrift, she had done the very best she could, according to her lights, to work even-handed justice, and up to this very day believed that the haft of the scales was the true one. Then she fell to a-crying bitterly that her darling Grad should be ousted, and then she laughed _as heartily that her dear boy Clayton was in for it. With timid glances at Mrs O’Gaghan, like a boy’s at a schoolmaster, Jane Cripps came in, and told all she knew, saying ‘ Please sir,’ at every sentence. She had seen at the time Dr Hutton’s sketch, which was made without Biddy’s knowledge, be cause she never would have allowed it, on account of the bad luck to follow. And Mrs Cripps was very clever now everything was known. She had felt all along that things went queerly on the third day after the babes were born. She had made up her mind to speak at the time, only Mrs O’Gaghan was such —excuse her—such a disciplinarian, that —that —and then Lady Nowell died, and everything was at sixes and sevens, and no one cried more violent, let them say what they like about it, than the Jane Penny as had been. * If Sir Cradock thought further evidence needful, there was Mrs Bowyer, a most re spectable woman, who washed thirty shil lings a week, Mrs Cripp’s first cousin and co-mate, who had heard at the time all .about the drawing, and had not been easy about the scales, and had dreamed of it many times afterwards, as indeed her Aunt Betsy know; and her husband was no man, or he never would have said to her—’ By this time the shadows came over the room, and the trees outside were rustling, and you could see them against the amber sunset, like a child’s scrawling on his horn book. Volunteers throughout the house hold longed to give their evidence. Their self-respect for a week would be hostile, if it were not accepted. But Sir Cradoek kept the door fastened, till Mrs O’G-aghan slipped out, and put ail the wenches down the steps backwards. Mrs Toaster alone she durst not touch ; but Mrs Toaster will never forgive her, and never believe the case tried on its merits, because she was not summoned to depose to the loan of the scales. Ha, so it is in our country, and among the niggers also. When wealth, position, title, even bastardom from princes, even the notoriety which a first-rate murderer stabs for—when any of these are in ques tion, how we crowd into the witness-oox, how we feel the reek of the court an aureola on our temples. Hut let any poor fellow, noble unknown, an upright man now on the bend with trouble, let him go in to face his creditors, after the uphill tight of years, let him gaze around with work-worn eyes— which of his friends will be there to back him, who will give him testimony. After all what matters it except in the score against us? We are bitter with the world, we make a fuss, and feel it fester, we explode in small misanthropy, only be cause we have not in our heart-sore the true balm of humanity. .No longer let our watchword be ‘ Every man for himself, and God for us all,’ but ‘Every man for God, and so for himself and all.’ Ho may we do away with that illicit process, and return to the primal axiom that ‘ the greater contains the less.' Chapter XYIII. The rays of the level sun were nestling in the brown bosom of the beech-clump, and the fugitive light went undulating through the grey-arched portico, like a reedy river; when Cradock and Olayion Nowell met in the old hall of their childhood. With its deep embrasures, and fluted piers, high corniced mantel of oak relieved with alabas ter figures, and the stern array of pike, and steel-cap, battle-axe, and arquebus, which kept the stag-heaus over against them nodding in perpetual fear, this old hall was so impressed upon their earliest memories, that they looked upon it, in some sort, as the entrance lo their lives. As the twins drew near from opposite doors, each hung back for a moment: knowing all that had passed that day, how would nis brother receive him? Uut in that moment each perceived now the other's heart was; Cradock cried, * Hurrah, ah right I’and Clayton’s arms were round his neck. Clayton sobbed hysterically —for he had always been woman-heartea —while Cradock coaxed inm with his hand, as if he were ten years the elder. It was as though the days of childhood had returned once more, ihe days when the world came not between them, but they were tne world to each other. ; Crad, I won’t have a bit of it.

It was the first day that he had been off by himself since the arrival of Annie Noble, and he had imagined that it would be a relief to be entirely independent, with no one by to act as a restraint, or require at tention from him. But he did not enjoy it half so much as he had expected : the hours seemed long, and he missed the merry laugh and bright little face which had of late been such a source of enjoyment to him ; while more than once a regretful sigh escaped him as he remem bered how keenly he must have wounded the child to have made her shun him so persistently. It was between four and five in the after noon when he put up his fishing-rod, and with his basket well filled with "" speckled beauties,"" turned his face homeward. Making his way back to tho lake, he found his boat where he had left it, and leaping into it, he pushed off, and putting a bold stroke to his oars, he pulled for the opposite shore. Half way across the lake there was a tiny island, and just as he was about to round it he heard the dip of another pair of oar?, add the next moment, he ?aw Mr Noble's lieht little boEt, with Annie and her maid in it, pulling in the same direction as him self He nodded gayly to them, and called out cheerily, a"" if there had been no misunder standing between him and his little friend : "" Been over to Moss Island, Annie ?"" ""No,"" she returned, in a subdued fone, and rowing more slowly, as if to let him pass her ; ""we have been lily hunting."" ""Have you had good luck?"" he a<=ked. hoping;, boy-like, that she would inquire regarding his success as a fisherman. "" Pretty good,"" still demurely. ""Guess what I have in my basket,"" and he tanped it lightly as he spoke. '• Fish."" she returned, indifferently. ""Of course -and tront. Such beauties, too ! Now guess how many."" ""I can't. I'm very stupid at guessing:,"" she replied, sedately ; then, backing water with one oar, she turned her boat h-Uf around, exclaiming, with sudden interest : "" Sarah, there is a lovely lily there— l must have it !"" Sarah and Rich both looked where she pointed, and, trueenouerh, there was a most beautiful lily just, beyond their boat. As they neared it, Annie lpft her oar, and going to the stern, leaned far out, reaching her hand as deep into the water as she could, so as to secure as long a stem a 5 * possible. ""Take care, Annie l "" Rich called out, his heart in his mouth as he saw her dangerous position. But his warning came too late ; for the •words were scarcely uttered when she lo3t her balance and, with a sharp cry of terror, disappeared beneath the water. The maid, losing her presence of mind, dropped her oar, and began to shriek in a way that might have aroused the fabled eeven s'eepers. But Rich, with a tew swift strokes of his oars, was alongside their boat in an instant, and watched for Annie to rise to the surface that he might reach for and save her. But she did not rise ! There were only gradually widening circles and a few bubbles where she had fallen, while the water was so muddy that he could see nothing beneath the surface. In a few moment? his jacket and shoes were off and he had spruug into those murky depths. He, too, disappeared, and was under water so long: that tha girl was in despair, believing that both were lost. But at last Rich came to the surface, bearing in his arm? the senseless form of his little comrade, while both were covered with mud and clime. "" Stop your crying and screaming, Sarah, and help us!""' Kich commanded, sternly ; and, awed into obedience, she took the child from him, when he crawled into the boat with all the speed he could, and grasping the oars, pulled for the shore with a rapidity which only a desperate purpose could haye prompted. As soon as they landed he seized the still unconscious girl in his arms and ran for the farmhouse. There waa busy work among those terror etricken people during the hour which fol lowed ; there were pale faces and fcinking hearts gathered around that little form, for it was a hard battle that they fought with the grim foe, Death, who seemed very loth to yield that sweet spirit back to life again. But the terrible suspense w ib over at last, and little Annie Noble opened her blue eyes and smiled up into the agonised faces bend ing above her. Then Rien, who had refused, despite his soiled and dripping clothing, to leave her until he could Know whether she would live or die, gave a cry of joy tha ended in a groan of pain, and he fell fainting upon the floor. He had hurt himself badly, grazing one eide in pulling himself into the boat, while he had strained his back with violent row ing, and then in parrying his burden up the bank and all the way to the farm house. He was confined to his bed all the next day, but the second morning he felt much better, though he was still very lame and sore, and only able to limp from his bed to the lounge in his aunt Audrey's room, and there Annie, who wa3 none the worse for her di a agreeable bath, pave a slight feel ing of weakness and langour and looking rather pale, hovered about him all day long, waiting upon him and anticipating his slightest wieh. \* hen first told that she might go in to see him, she walked straight up to him, holding out both hands. "" Rich,"" she said. and her voice trembled, ** you are very brave, and I wish I hadn't said that the other day, and I'm corry I was so rude and naughty."" He drew her down to him and kissed her, for the tears in her blue eyes emote him. Her contrite confession told him something of how ehe had grieved over his words. ""Never mind that any more,"" he re turned. ""I have forgotten everything, Annie, but your narrow escape and that you are cafe now."" Hia very lips grew pale as he remembered how terrible her danger had been, and bow he had found her entangled among the weeds, and half pinned down into the mud by the fork of a dead limb that adhered to ±he bottom. "" Papa eaya you are the most wonderful fcey he ever saw,"" the child continued 5 ""be eayB there aren't many who would have had the courage to stay under water j co loop *od hunt for me. I heard him tell 1 Miss Waldemar so: you ought to have eeen ' how pretty she grew when he said it. She smiled so beautiful, jusfc as m/ inaninia used to, when sho was proud and glad over anythiner. And then her eyes got so soft and loving when she paid, ' Kich was always a good boy ; yes, and a brave boy, too.' "" ""Did Aunt Audrey say that?"" Kich asked, his face flushing with pleasure Those few loving words were more to him than the most extravagant praise from any one else. "" Of course she did, or I couldn't tell you about it,"" returned Annie, bluntly; ""and, Rich, I think Miss Waldemar. is just the loveliest lady in the world. I wish she was my 'Aunt Audrey,' too,"" she concluded, confidingly. Miss Waldemar herself entered the room, thus cutting short the eulogy upon her charms. Going up to the young people, she bent over Rich, asking how he was feeling. "" Better, thank you, Aunt Audrey ; I shall be all right to-morrow, I think.""' She smoothed the clustering curls away from his forehead, and bending still lower, kissed its white surface softly. "" I am very proud of my dear boy, but I should have been heart-broken if anything serious had happened to him,"" sho said, with a quiver in her voice. He took her hand troin his head and held it close in his, but a choking sen-ation came into his throat and he could uot speak. Annie stood by while this little scene was being enacted, and there was tuch an earnest, wistful look in her eyes that Audrey's heart yearned toward tho little motherless girl more than ever before. She sat down by Kich, and with her dis engaged hand drew her to her side and touched her lip? softly to her p-ilo cheek. ""It was a narrow escape tor jou both ; wasn't it, little one ?"" she said, with a irrave tenderness. "" Yes'm,"" and the child's fair, rourd arm stole almost unconsciously about, her neck and clung to her w it li a loving clasp. ""I wish—"" she began, and then slcpped. ""You wi*h whut. dear.'""' Airhcy a^ked, encouragingly "" May - I call yon auntie, roo ? and maj' I come and kiss you every <i'ay '? —you know I haven't eot any mamma,"" this Li^t in such a plaintive tone that it went, to the heart of both her listeners. Audrey folded her close in both arms ""Indee>» >ou may, darling, if you wish, and I shall like it very much, for you know, /haven't any Irfth nhl."" ""Oh. but you've got lhch, and heY better than a do/en girl-."" Annie responded, with an adoring iook at the jouth Audrey and Rich both lamrhed aloud a* this extravagant estimate of his worth, and I the rather doubtful compliment which ?hc thus paid the young ot her own sex, and then the conversation drifted into other channels. Audrey ""Waldemir, at thirty-two, v ■"" ;i surpassingly lo\ely wonnn, while her \ ar. ; sat so lightly upon her that one v. . uld scarcely believe they had numbered so many by half adozan. She won all hearts wherever she went In manner she was peculiaily winning and gracious ; her tmile wa« re^tles 3 . Adrien Noble had been drawn toward her from the moment of their introduction, and, as day after day he was thrown into her society, and he came to realise that «ho was as love'y in character a« in person, his lonely heart began to yearn for the paramount right to such svveet companionship. •'What a ble??ino- she is to that nephew of her£ !"" he often remarked to him-elf. "" What a mother s-he would be to my little mischievous elf, who vidlyneedssnch a gentle restraining hand, and to be hedged about with the refining influences ot a nature like herd !"" So with something of a purpose like this taking root in his heart, he sought her more and more. He planned long drives for the beautiful morninu?, always shrewdly including Mrs Allen in the invitations, for it was plain to be seen that the good woman admired him exceedingly ; w hile if the truth w ere know n, she had already begun to weave a little romance all by herself, in which Mr Noble and Audrey formed the central figures. One day, Mrs Allen was indispo?ed and obliged to keep her own room, acd Mr Noble and Audrey were the only occupants of the north piazza. The two children were playing croquet on the lawn a dozen rods away, and apparently absorbed in their game and in each other. "" Quite a chivalrous young knight and devoted lady,"" observed Mr Noble, with his rare smile, as Rich, after knocking his an tagonist's ball far beyond the bound iry of the ground, started upon the full run to bring it within the pioper Hmita again. "" Yes,"" Audrey replied ; "" I believe they have formed a friendship which will last throughout their lives."" They watched the youthful player* in silence for several moments ; but if Audrey had been observant of her companion, she would have seen that he had lost some thing of his usual colour, while the lines about his mouth had settled into a resolute expression, iit length he looked up at her, and remarked, with deep earnestness : "" I hope the ?ame may be true regarding you and me, Miss Waldemar "" "" Indeed, Mr Nobla, I think it is,""' Audrey [ promptly returned. ""It has been a great pleasure to me to make your acquaintance this summer."" "" May I not designate it by a stronger word than that of ' friendship ?""' ho pleaded, in a low, eager tone, adding: ""Miss Waldemar,l cannot longer defer telling you how dear you have become to me during the weeks we have spent together. The fire and passion of youth, perhaps, are past for me, but there has cmc into mv heart an enduring affection for you which can only ceaf c w hen 1 cea s e to live If this is a surprise to you - if I seem presumptuous in this declaration upon s <) short an aoquaint ance, do not answer mo now ; take time and consider it, and when you are assured of the i*f sponge of your own heart, let me come to you and win you for my wife. This may seem like a very prosaic, inatter of fact wooing; but, Mi=»s Waldemar- Audrey, if you will let me call you so -there i*-- a strength and depth to my love for you that cannot be measured or expressed by words. Will you give me just one word of hope ?"" He leaned toward her, gazing earnestly iiito her face ; and as she glanced at him the saw that his whole heart was in what he had just said to her, and the intensity of his words and looks thrilled her, in ppite of the knowledge that she could not then or ever give him the hope he craved. She was very pale now ; it recalled go vividly that other wooing, when her heart [had gone forth in such glad, fond lesponse to her eager lover — when Arthur Halstead had asked her to be his wife, and she had so trustfully laid her hand in his and had given herself to him. She knew that she still belonged to him, even though he was the husband of another. Slje had never met him during all those long years, yet she loved him just as truly to-day as then, and she *elt that she nevor could become the wife of another with his image so sacredly enshrined withjin hep eoul. ""Mr Noble, 5 ' she said, after' a short silence, f ' when you said that you hoped for an enduring friendship between us, my he^rt responded promptly to the wish, for I felt that I should be glad to repognise in you a true friond during the coming years of my lifo But whoti you a*k for a nearer relationship I roust say no.

CHAPTER 111 Pbbhaps the most watchf ul and interested specta tor of the 'affectionate relations between young John Tompkins and Miss. G-eorgina Pinkie was Mr Giles Slycroft, the head clerk and confidential man. of business. Few who saw that outwardly calm and unruffled exterior knew the storm of passion that was raging beneath.' The nature of this man, Slycroft, was like some treacherous whirlpool in a deep river. It flows gently onward with hardly a ripple on its sunlit surface, but in its depths are fatal eddies that are full of danger and loathsome things. Slycroft went about his ordinary business with his old methodical regu larity, and the same cold, unimpassioned expres sion on his face. He was polite to Miss G-eorgina, ostentatiously deferential to Mr Tompkins, and obsequiously respectful to Mr Pinkie. But there were times when dark and dangerous suggestions obtruded themselves on his medita tions. Tompkins was the one obstacle between him and the goal of his ambition. Tompkins had come in like an interloper at the moment when hopes which he had so long and secretly nursed seemed in a fair way of being realised. Slycroft had not asked himself whether he loved G-eorgina Pinkie. It seemed to him a matter of no moment whether he loved her or not. Wealth and social position were more to him than sentiment, and, having set his heart on those, he was not a man to relinquish them without a struggle. He weighed his chances like a cool man of business, just as ho would have calculated the prospects of any of the various speculations in which the firm was engaged, and he saw clearly that fate seemed to be against him. But still he did not despair. He had confidence in his own skill and resources. He had fought many a hard battle against odds, and conquered — he was fight ing a hard battle every day of his life, of which the world about him knew and suspected nothing. He had already sown distrust of Tompkins in the mind of Pinkie, by dark hints at the young man's extravagant and Bohemian habits, his un godliness, and questionable company ; he had gone so far as to make mysterious allusions to gambling and betting. If he could only involve Tompkins in some discreditable transaction, a street brawl, a drunken debauch which would get him into the Police Court, or entrap him into disgrace in any other way, this obstacle might be removed from his path, and he would trust to his own good luck and ingenuity for the rest. ■ But in spite of his sanguine nature, the goal seemed to recede farther and father off. He knew' that only a bold stroke, or some un expected piece of luck, would save him. The traps he had set for young Tompkins had all failed. Beneath the bonhomie and easy good nature of his rival there was a depth of shrewd ness and worldly wisdom that saved him from dangerous execesses. The most vigilant surveil lance of his habits and haunts failed to reveal anything worse than those venial social vices to •which young men in his station are generally addicted. Meantime there was nothing to interrupt the course of true love between Tompkins and Miss G-eorgina, and it was evident that matters must soon come to a climax. They were as inseparable as Juno's swans. Whenever Mrs Pinkie and her daughter attended the opera, a lawn tennis party, or an archery meeting, the young man was invari ably their escort. It was soon bruited about among the Joneses, the Binkses, the Podgers, and the other fashionable families of Parnell that Mr Tompkins and Miss Greorgiua were engaged, and that the young man was only waiting for a big remittance from a rich maiden aunt to lead G-eorgina .to the altar. Even the names of the bridesmaids were settled. When these things were hinted to old Pinkie he merely shrugged Tiis shoulders and observed, "" I leave these matters to the missus. She understands 'em better than I do, and I dessay it's all right. When it comes off I'll let you know."" CHAPTEE IV. One quiet summer evening, after the business of the day was over, and Slycroft had finished his solitary dinner, he sat looking out from the verandah over the waters of the Waiteniata, meditating on things in general. For some weeks past he had been more reconciled to the tendency of events. He had begun to ask himself whether after all it would be prudent to resign himself 4o the inevitable, and cultivate the friendship of young Tompkins. "" Even if he does marry the girl,"" he mused ""there is nothing to prevent my becoming a partner in the business."" There is no use in playing a losing game, and perhaps weakening my own chances by making an enemy of the old woman. Her heart is evidently set on this * match, else why should she encourage him so much to the house, and leave them so often together. Depend upon it she'll have her way. She manages old Pinkie as she likes. If I get between them I shall go to the wall. My game ■ is to swim with the stream."" . ' And then Slycrof t's thoughts wandered away to Miss Haberdash, daughter of the whole sale draper, who had smiled on him so sweetly in the Sunday-school, and squeezed his hand so tenderly as they parted on their way home from the choir practice. ""Old Haberdash must have a pretty good business,"" he thought; ""he has shares in the Shotover and Longdrive, and no end of property. Why lie must have netted quite £2000 from that J^t Shotover dividend. I think I'll make up to ' her.

"" Your hand on it,"" said Flopper. They shook hands warmly, and the young man hastened away to tell his discovery to all the neighbourhood. Slycroft laughed. He laughed so heartily and so loud that old Mrs Muggles was quite startled, and a momentary suspicion flashed across the good lady's mind that her lodger had been drinking, for she alone of all the world knew that occasionally he solaced his lonely bachelor even ings with a bottle of whiskey. Slycroft went out, and it was past midnight when Mrs Muggles heard the sound of his latch key when he returned. CHAPTER V Young Tompkins had also been out late. 3?irst of all he had to escort Mrs Pinkie and G-eorgina home from the twenty -fifth half-yearly meeting of the Distressed Widows' Aid Society, alter which trying ordeal he felt the need of some thing to cheer his depressed spirits, and had con sequently, like Slycrof t, to use his latch-key. He was not an early riser at any time, and it was already afternoon before he set out on his visit to Pinkie Villa, to offer his devotions at the shrine of the fair Georgina. As he walked down Con stitution Hill smoking his silver-mounted meer schaum pipe, and followed by his retriever "" Pompey,"" he was a good deal surprised when Joe Podgers, who was coming along from the.op posite direction, deliberately "" cut "" him, and he was absolutely astonished when, near Parnell Uise, Mr Saintley, the respected churchwarden, returned his familiar nod with a repulsive scowl, ""Whew l what's up, I wonder?"" he solilo quised -, "" has anyone been blabbing about that spree with the football club ?"" When he reached Pinkie Villa and rang the bell, instead of the fair G-eorgina rushing out to welcome him, he was admitted by the servant and shown into old Pinkie's office, called by cour tesy a study, where the old gentleman retired to smoke his pipe and to look over his private ledger. This was so unusual that poor Tompkins began to feel downhearted, and to cast about in his mind as to what particular sin he had com mitted. But he was not long left in doubt. Presently he heard the heavy footsteps of Pinkie, and a glance at the old man's face betokened a storm. Tompkins rose and held out his hand. Pinkie waved him off with a gesture of ineffable dis gust, and exclaimed, in tones of suppressed pas sion, ""Y,ou damned scoundrel! 'ow dare you'ave the cheek for to come 'ere again !"" ""My dear Mr Pinkie "" — began Tompkins, turning pale. ""Don't dear Pinkie me, sir!"" shouted the choleric old gentleman. "" I tell you, sir, you're a low, dirty cheat and scoundrel ! and if you ever come near this 'ere place agin, I'll send you out on the toe of my boot."" ""G-ood heavens!"" shouted Tompkins, ""what have I done to merit this ?"" ""Well; you've got a face on you, you We,"" said Pinkie, with a sickly laugh. ""You, the father of a fam'ly, for to come out 'ere a-doin' the 'eavy swell and jam-tart business, a-gittin' into people's 'ouses, and a-passing ov yerself hoff as a ""single man ! You needn't try to come the hinnocent dodge on me, now."" Tompkins had started from his chair, and was regarding old Pinkie with open-mouthed jamaze ment. ""Married!— father of a family!"" ; ""Yes,"" said Pinkie, in a mocking tone, *' three on 'em ; and it',s my opinion, Mr Tompkins, as you ought td be'a^ lomiß Ipolan' aiftfer 'em, instead o Vi gallivantin' aw)und'the Mbnies and a-bringin' respectable people into disgrace."" '. i "" It's some horrible conspiracy — some frightful nistake !"" gasped the young man. "" Ain't your name John Toinpkins ?"" yelled ?inkle. ""Yes."" "" Don't you hail from Lunnon ?"" "" Yes, of course ; but "" — ""No buts, you brazen-faced villyun !"" thun lered Pinkie, in a voice that made the pendants )f a chandelier tremble. "" Just read that,"" and, tossing a newspaper towards Tompkins, the old gentleman collapsed into a chair, and mopped his face with an antimacasser. As the young man read the paragraph in the Daily Telegraph, his eyes almost started from lis head, hia hair stood on end, and his knees ;rembled. It was like reading his own death warrant. He sank into a chair, and regarded Pinkie with a gaze of speechless horror. • The paragraph ran as follows: — ""A pitiable story of cruel desertion and bitter want was told by a poor woman who gave her name as Louisa Tompkins, at the Marylebone Police Court yes terday. The woman, who was miserably attired, and had an infant at her breast and two other half-starved and half -naked children at her side, told the Bench that about six months ago she had been cruelly deserted by her husband, John Tompkins — a young man of edxication and means; and that being near her confinement at the time, she had been obliged to pawn her furniture and wearing apparel, and was now in an utterly des titute and starving condition. She produced a certificate of marriage, and applied for relief, or an order for admittance to the Marylebone work house. The Bench gave an order on the Poor Relief Fund, and directed Mr Superintendent Harkshaw to take out a warrant for the appre hension of John Tompkins. The heartless villain is supposed to have emigrated to New Zealand. He is said to be £ wanted ' also on a charge of embezzlement."" "" Bowled out, eh ?"" said Pinkie, with wither ing sarcasm. ""Mr Pinkie — sir — pray hero me. I assure you on my sacred word of honour "" — "" There now, cheese that 1"" wrathfully ex claimed Pinkie ; ""your sacred fiddlesticks ! The hidea of a waggabond like you to talk of 'onour. Grit out o' my 'ouse this minnit !"" "" It's some frightful mistake, Mr Pinkie — I know it is,"" pleaded the vngabond. "" Eoflcct for one moment. There are scores of people of the name of Tompldns in London."" ""Well, you're a cool card, you are,"" said Pinkie, in tones of mock admiration. "" I -wonder 'off many more gals you've took in in your time. You're a nice young man for a small tea party, you are,"" and Tompkins rose from his chair and made a gesture towards the door. ""Pray calm yourself, Mr Pinkie. I'll show you my letters. I'll "" — . "" You'll clear out o' this, you scoundrel — that's wot you'll do,"" said Pinkie, as he rose from his chair and advanced towards Tompkins in a menacing attitude. The latter dodged round the table, knocked over a bust of Gceorge Washington with a crash, and had just time to escape an upraised boot and skip out of the gate, when he heard a terrific howl and the "" Seol him, Tiger ! sool him, boy !"" of old Pinkie, and saw that ferocious animal bound after the hat which the old man had thrown after him, an affront which was promptly resented by "" Pompey "" ; and the last recollec tion he had of the paradise from which he had been ignomiuiously expelled was of the two dogs fighting in the midst of a confused melee of all the canines in the neighbourhood, and the figure of old Pinkie on the verandah, wildly gesticulating with his upraised fist.

Sir, —As a Dunedin visitor, present at the meeting held in the Chamber of Com merce Hall this afternoon, to discuss matters relative to tbe representation of Canterbury at this Exhibition, I was ex tremely gratified to notice that though, unfortunately, the attendance was some what limited, those present manifested a good deal of interest in the project, and the tone of the speakers indicated that Christchurch, at any rate, is going to take a real lively interest in the affair. This ia quite as it should be, because is ' not the Exhibition to be a national one as far as New Zealand is concerned, and will we not all be participators in the general benefit the Colony is going to derive from it P It is true, as was remarked at the meeting, that if the thing were not heartily entered into here just now, Christchurch would, regret it before this year is out. I write therefore just now to suggest that the Executive Committee convene another public meeting, to be held at a time in the evening when all merchants, tradesmen, and others would find it convenient to attend, for the pur pose of hearing addresses from members of the Committee and others on the impor tance of at once entering practically into the project, and taking steps to make the Exhibition project l as popular as possible with the Christchurch people, because all should be brought to understand as clearly as possible that this is not a Dunedin affair merely, but a New Zealand Exhibi tion. —I am &c., G.

Sib, — I seo from a report in the New Zealand Times of to-day that at the in quest hold on the body of tha man who was drowned at the wharf the other day, tho Coroner drew attention to the regulation providing for a net being placed under tha gangways of vessels, and suggesting that the net should be extended tho whole length of tho ship. No doubt this would be very good as a means for preventing people falling off tho wharf or ship from being drowned, but there should no neces sity whatever for such a precaution in relation to tho gangway. Tho gangways used on, say, tho Auckland ferry steamers or at sea-ports at Home for passenger traffic are so constructed that a child could cross over on them without any danger of falling off, but for tho general steamer traffic in the New Zealand ports the con trivances used as gangways are. With ai occasional exception, such as require a considerable amount of courage and ac robatic ability to venture upon—especially when placed at certain angles. Why should tho Harbour Boards of the Colony allow steamship companies to place unsafe bridges over dangerous chasms, while no other governing body in the land would dare to permit openings in frequented footpaths to be insecurely bridged ? Fancy our City Council temporarily bridging a dangerous break in one of the city footpaths .by a plank with a single slhck rope fdfc handrail, and that only on the middle portiori of the plank, and only on one side of it, perhaps, and placing a net under neath to catch nervous people who fall off!

Yes I I think it means a storm, and a pretty heavy one, too. See, even now the clouds are gathering, and the big drops are beginning lo fall. It was my fault not to have noticed it. Let us hurry home.’ Maiblucmchen would have rather liked the fun of getting a little wet, but Yal was obdurate, so holding on to his arm, she almost ran up the hill, in order to keep pace with his long strides. * Yon hurry home, too, Val,’ she said as she reached her door. * It’s the new moon, and that is generally when the weather changes. It has been so sultry all day, I shouldn’t wonder if we had thunder, and that always makes me so afraid. I always think of the judgment day and the bodies rising from their graves.’ Val was deathly pale, bin she did not notice it, as she tripped in and bade him good night. The cloud on his face had been deepening every day lately, and ho carried his dream with him as a load, that grew daily heavier. Val did not go straight home, although the big drops wore coming down in earnest now. He did not seem to notice the wet, but strode on, looking neither to the right and left, until he reached the “ Gasthaus Zum Hascn.”. ‘ Here’s V'al 1’ cried a number of jonng fellows nil together, who were seated aronnd a table with their singing books open; ‘You’re just in time; we want another first tenor, for Toulle here does not know the * Drei Yaegcr.’ Come on, Yal, it’s a wet night, and we can sing until the Polizdstunde, three good hours yet..’ ‘ Not to-night, boys,’ said Yal; ‘ I’m in no mood to sing, and besides, I must go home.’ Then turning to mine host of the “ Haro,” he said : ‘ Herr Hasen wirth, give mo a bottle of the best brandy that yon have. My mother is subject to attacks of colic lately, and I wish to have some in the house on her account.’ As he marched out with the bottle under his arm without even saying good night to his companions, ; they paused for a moment as if one and nil felt there was something wrong, which they did not understand. At last, Ton’le, the joiner; broke the silence and said : * I wonder what alls Val Bremer lately. He looks so stern and sad. If this comes of being in love, I hope I may die heart whole. Besides, I never heard of his mother having colic. Only last Sunday she was felling Frau Gottheil that she had not had an ache or a pain in twenty years ! ’ And then they went on with their singing. * * # * » It was, indeed, a fearful night, for although the rain abated somewhat about eleven o’clock, the thunder peals from time to time, which followed the dazzling sheets of lightning, were evidence that the storm was far from over. The Nockar was already swollen, turbid and muddy, and no trace of the original gutters was visible in the streets, as sheets of water swept down the hill of Berg into the river. Valentino’s mother had retired early and he bade her not be frightened at the storm, which he assured her, would be over before morning, ‘ Frightened, Val, !’ she replied, ‘I have held you in my arms as a baby on many a worse night than this and yon never woke up. The Bremers and Weides are made of better stuff than to be scared at n storm when the good God sends one. Good-night, and pleasant dreams, my son I Yon want rest, for you have looked overworked and tired of late.” About half past eleven Val peeped into bis mother’s room. She was sleep ing soundly. Going back to bis own little room he rumpled the bedclothes, drew a spade and pick from under the bed, also an old-fashioned lantern and then, filling a large flask with brandy, and taking o draught first, he hid tho bottle under the mattress, put on a heavy overcoat and slipped out into ; the darkness. He locked tho door noise lessly and placed the key in his pocket. ‘ Hie first brandy [ ever drank,' ho muttered; ‘how brave it makes one feel, Ach Gotl 1 But I need it for this job !’ On he splashed through the mud and water to the back of the village. Once ho started and felt his heart thump as a vivid flash of lightning revealed an object close to him on the side of the road. ‘Pshaw! yon coward!’ lie said to himself, ‘scared at an old cow getting out of the wet under a tree by the cemetery gate.’ Then he opened the gate, lit his lantern under the wall and made straight for tho grave of Claus Weide In tho pauper’s plot. He could have found the way blindfolded. Ho had been there every day lately. Jnst as tho clock struck midnight a rift in the clonds showed the now moon. (To be continued. )",Fiction

In opposing the present Executive, I believe fche senior member for Porirua honestly thinks that; he represents his constituents. Living among fchem, however, 1 am convinced that not one in twenty of them approve of his pre sent antagonistic attitude, and nofc one in fifty would care fco see him holding the reins again in a Provincial Executive. Almost every elec tor in Porirua knows Mr Brandon personally, and has great respect for him both as a trust worthy lawyer and an old friend, but fche lato election for lhe Assembly showed that though Mr Brandon still retained the personal regard of his constituents, a good many of them, on political grounds only, felfc constrained to give their votes fco an almost unknown candidate. The general verdict on fchat election was, thafc if a good man had come forward for the seat Mr Brandon would have lost ifc.

Sir, —Strange that it should devolve upon a coroner’s jury to “ recommend "" the Tramway Company to do what the law says it shall do. Strange also is it that the law should have been systematically ignored from tho first day of the company's existence. Regarding stopping places on the line of route, tho “ Order ” issued under the band of William Fitzherberfc, Superintendent, in accordance with the terms of the Tramways Act, 1872, specifically directs that— “ Carriages will stop between Pipitea Point and Drummond-street at the following places —Charlotte-street and Lambton-quay junction, Lambton-quay and Johnston-street junction, Lambton-quay and Grey-strect junction, Lambton-quay and Wiliis-strcet junction, Willis-strect and Manners-street junction. Manners-street and Cuba-strect junction, Cuba-street and Ingestre-street junction, Ingestre-etreet and Taranaki-street junction, Vivian-street and Tory-stroet junction, Viviau street and Cambridge Terrace junction, Sussex Square and Adelaide-road junction.” We have a City Solicitor, a Town Clerk, and an Inspector of Nuisances, part of whose duty it is to regulate the passenger traffic of the city. I cannot say whether it is the function of either or any of these officials to see that the tramway regulations are enforced, hut it is remarkable that while the hackney carriage by-laws are carried out with a rigor that would gratify the heart of the Emperor of all the Russias, the tramway regulations are as little cared for as tho unspoken thoughts of the Pro phet «f Damascus. I do not wish to be misunderstood in this matter. The tramway is unquestionably a great public convenience, but I hold that it would be a still greater convenience if the re gulations framed in the public interest were properly observed.

He hnd taken a thorough course at a riding academy in the eastern metropolis he hailed from ; no Montane bronco could get away with him. The boys around the corral winked at each other and did their best to get the tenderfoot on that buckskin bronco's back. The majority of them had dealt with such men be fore, and they knew there was more fun to be extracted from a smart Aleck ancl a wild bronco than from any other combination under the sun. 'You're a rider,' said Joe Collins enthusiastically, ' I can see it stickin' right out of you.' ' I flatter myself 1 can ride a little,' said the tenderfoot with a gratified smile. ' ' If you can get a saddle and bridle on that bronco, I'll show you a few tricks at horse breaking. The bronco was scarcely larger than a good-sized colt, and he stood by the corral with head down and little body hunched up as though he anticipated some attempt at riding him. He looked very mcck — that buck skin bronco — but his meekness was gone in a moment when he saw Joe Collins lugging towards him a big 'greaser' saddle with a double cinch and a horsehair bridle. It took four men to saddle and bridle that little piece of lightning, but at last ifc was done and Joe Collins told the tenderfoot the bronco was ready, ' Observe, gentleman,' said Smith (I'll call him Smith, bufc that wasn't his name), ' that science v.' ins fche day against brute force every time.' Then he went up tp the, bronco just like he was leading off some new figure in a German. Before you could say I 'Jack Robinson/ .Mr Bronco wheeled around aud shot out his hind feet in snch a way as to give Smith a love-pat that floored him. ' Science ' got a black eye thafc time, and it took Smith ten minutes. to recover. ' Got enough ? asked Joe Collins. 1 No, sir,' said Smith, rather feebly, thought ' he took me unawares, but I'll look out for that kind of a move ment this time.' ' That's the kind of a bird a bronco is,' said Collins ; can't tell what they'ie going to do. They're just like Indians —deceitful.' Smith went at it a little differently next time, and succeeded in <*retthi"" into the saddle, but the horse wouldn't budge. That's a regular bronco trick. They'll stand stock still sometimes, like a piece of stone, and then of a sudden away they'll go like a Hash. Then Smith said : ' You see, gentle men, the horse is paralysed into obedience. He knows, by instinct, that his master is in the saddle, and he is endeavoring to recover his horse sense. We will help him recover it. Mr Collins, may I troublb you to get a pitchfork and tickle him in the flank ? 1 Any thin', anything Mr Smith,' said Joe, and he gofc a pitchfork with a yery long handle and proceeded to ' touch up ' the bronco. Well, he moved, ancl we can get an affidavit from every one present that he moved so .quick he splintered out into a whole herd of broncos, and the heavens were full, of Smith. Smith fell at* least loft from where the horse threw him, and Mr Bronco disappeared in the horizon at the cardinal point that lay nearest his old Montana home. Smith was unconscious when we picked him up, ancl he remained so for several days — out of his head all the time. He had an idea he hacl been riding a cyclone, that an earthquake hacl shaken him off, and that he. had fallen two or three miles and struck earth on the Rock of Gibraltar.

Bib,-—A few lines in reply to your article of yesterday re change of programme at the Theatre on Thursday evening last. A plain statement of facts will illustrate my position as manager of the Theatre. On Wednesday evening I issued the usual number of adver tisements, posters, pictures, &0., announcing the performance of “ The Duke’s Motto ” for Thursday evening. On these bill* I caused the name of the “ greatest ” tragedian in the world to be printed in the “smallest” pos sible type. The public ie by this time aware that this action was merely “ a Boland for an Oliver ” on my part for the gratuitous insult offered me by tho Kaiser of actors —Koenig of elocutionists—in the bill he hod put oat on the day previous. This matter can be of no interest to anyone bnt the eccentric himself, and I therefore drop it. But, Mr Editor, you charge me, as manager, with obtaining money from the public under false pretences. This is rather a grave subject ; and here is my reply. On Thurs day morning L saw a bill being strnck off to the order of “ genius ” announcing that the “ Lady of Lyons” would be substi tuted for ‘‘The Duke’s Motto” on that even ing at the Theatre Royal. Now, Mr Editor, this was the first intimation I bad bad of any change. I am the manager of the Theatre, and I allow no one under engagement to me (even though he be a shooting star fallen tram his celestial sphere into this out-of-the way portion of our planet) to issue announce ments as to what performances shall take place in my establishment. I, therefore, at once communicated with “ the most famous artiste of this century”, through his legal advisor, in these words:— (Copy.) Herr Bondmans. The “ Lady of Lyons” will not be played to night unless yon guarantee £6O in the house. If yon do not appear in “ The Duke’s Motto,” you will have broken yonr contract, and I shall proceed accordingly. Walter Reynolds. P.S—""The Duke’s Motto"" has been tho roughly rehearsed to-day. The “ Shaughrauu” shall be played if you like. You see, Mr Editor, by this I was deter mined, if possible, to keep faith with the public. In a couple of hours I received this letter from the “star’s” solicitor, copy of which I append : (Copy.) Walter Reynolds, Esq.—l find it is absolutely impossible for mo to perform in “The Date’s Motto"" this evening. The enclosed certificate will speak for itself. I propose that we should take ""The Lady of Lyons” instead, for, as you will see, my character (Claude Melnotte) is light, and needs no rehearsal. Here, Mr Editor, is a copy of certificate— (Copy of medical certificate.) Christchurch, March 17, 1881. I hereby certify that Herr Bandmann is under treatment by me, and he seems suffering so severely from nervous debility that I have advised him for a few days to abstain, as much as possible, from all nervous and muscular exertion. John Wilkins, F.E.C.S. Now, Mr Editor, it had been hinted to me that a certificate would probably be forth coming, and for that reason I suggested “ The Shaughr&un,” because that piece would have been played entirely without the illustrious invalid ; and, had he not have rather chosen to risk his health than wound his vanity, that drama would have been announced for per formance in all the evening papers. But the “ world-famous” persisted in his resolution ; and, in (he name of humanity, I ask you, Mr Editor, whether you would have me force an universally celebrated actor to play such a part as Largardere, requiring—requiring well, I don't know what, in the teeth of his physician’s advice to abstain from all “ ner vous and muscular exertion.” There are moments, Mr Editor, when business must give way to sentiment. Two gentlemen requested the return of their money. I instantly handed it to them, as I would have done to every person in the house had they required it. You will then, I trust, acknowledge that there was no attempt on my part to obtain money under false pre tences. Lastly, Mr Editor, allow mo to state that I do not identify myself with any of the eccentricities of the ""most famous.” Some animals have longer ears than others, and, though mine may be just as lengthy as those of other members of the great family, still it gratifies my self-esteem to live under the delusion that I am better able than some of my acquaintance to conceal their propor tions from the world’s eyes.

Sir, — In the "" Otago Witness"" of 21st February X notice a communica tion headed ""Important Decision to Sheepowners,"" gained for them by Lowe,' of Manuherikia, a man notorious as being always at law with some party or another, but principally with the unlucky laborer that happens to incur his displeasure. * * * In this instance he seems to have a magis trate as willing to keep the laboring man under subjection as he can be hiniself, as will be seen from his de cision against : Tracy, and concluding remarks to other unfortunates of the same class. In making some remarks upon this decision, let me observe that New _ Year's Day, is a holiday all over the Christian world, and that no magistrate can impose a penalty on a man for not workirig pn that, day in either law or justice. In this instance, E..M. Simp T son places the shearer in the position of a weekly-wages man, and tells him plainly if the case had come before him in another form he would have to forfeit his wages up' 'to ls't January. Excellent squatter's law, no doubt ; ,but can Mr .Simpson, produce a statute from the multifarious law-books of Otago that enables' him to mulct a man in any • penalty for not . working/ or refusing to work , on New Year's Day. Besides, the shearer is moi*e of a con tract than a weekly- wages man, and as such' would be treated in the higher 'law'cdui'ts. '. The threats and bouncing -of Mr R.M. Simpson towards the labouring classes were quite uncalled for, and will gain' him no respect as a magis trate, nor any credit to those who placed him in that position. His duty is to decide cases that come before him on their 'merits. * * * If Vincent Pyke, Esq., had been on the Bench at Alexandra on the 2nd of February the squatters' catspaw Lowe would not have obtained such a triumph for his class. However, it is to be hoped that none of the Otago shearers will sign agreements next season without pro perly understanding the purport thereof, especially when dealing with grinders of the Lowe caste. Shearers have mpre need of agreements than squatters, because,their word is of more value than the squatters' now-a-days, -as I am quite prepared in many in stances to prove. In concluding my remarks, let me exhort the shearers and labouring classes of Otago, and New Zealand in general, to follow the example of the mother country, and join in i co-opera tive, unions in the, centres, of popula tion. If we can't gain independence individually, let us do it collectively. We are ,tne physical power and life of the colony. Let ua unite and add riches to physical force, and I should like to see the magisti'ate who then will award an unjust triumph to our common enemy I have no doubt if the shearers of Otago were to support Tracy,, and' bring the case forward in another ( form, as Mr Simpson says, to a higher court, it would come back with a new face on. — I am, <fee., One of Them.

Sir, —I have twice successfully appealed to the benevolent public on behalf of deserving invalids. It will, I think, be gratifying to those who so generously sub scribed to know that their funds procured what could not otherwise have, been ob tained, viz., change ""of air and very much improvement in one case, and the saving of life in the other ; and not only that, bub the money enabled mc to provide Labor saving machinery, by which the poor patient can now make a decent living, though still an invalid, and there is yet a little fund left for a rainy day if it comes. Both are very grateful. Ido not want money now, but I wish the charitably-dis posed to ask themselves this question —Is it fair to our own sick, needy and diseased poor to send such large sums of money out of this colony for the benefit of other people's poor, when there are so many who require help here? It is said, ""Charity begins at home, but should not end there."" Granted, but the fact of its beginning at home, I think, implies that it should satisfy all pressing requirements, and then if there is a surplus well and good ; it may go from ""home."" But some will say, ""There are not any really poor here."" Ask your doctor, ask those who distributed the Press fund, ask those who are connected with or manage charitable institutions of any or every denomination. The answer will be, "" There are pleDty, and if we had double the income we could expend it, and our sphere of usefulness is very much curtailed and circumscribed for want of more means."" I am impelled to make L these remarks because I see that Dr. Barhardo's emissary is come or coming to , New Zealand, and will doubtless take away a considerable sum Home with him. 11 grant his work is good and most praise ' worthy, but is it fair to come to this colony, especially at the present time, when the English nation saves a sum annually equal to its revenue ? I for one think not, especially when our charitable institutions suffer from impecuniosity. There is another (matter which is thrust upon us by the 'action or inaction of the Government, Municipal Boards and the Charitable Aid Boards, and that is the consideration of the increasing necessity for the establishment of a Lock Hospital. Of course the public generally do not see or believe in the necessity for it because they are not cognisant of the evils arising from its absence. There is a limit to the time of I such ignorance. By our inaction we are making a rod for our own backs and two or three for the backs of our children. Possibly some will accuse mc of exaggeration and cry shame on mc for even mentioning it. Future generations will be better judges. Why are such questions imported into insurance papers, whether for male or female lives * Depend upon it, they have not been put there without great considera tion and deliberation on the part of the directorate. If the guilty only suffered it would be bad enough, but unfortunately the innocent suffer too, often far more severely than the guilty. Some time since the Hospital and Charitable Aid Board set aside JBIOQO for the establishment of a Lock Hospital. With what result ? One which reminds us of the 16th verse of the 2nd chapter of the Epistle of St. James. The public may or may not believe it, but if this crying but insidious evil is allowed to continue its uninterrupted course, our ahildren and grandchildren will think we showed very little forethought or common sense, for which individuals, communities, and the State generally will suffer in many ways, disease and mortality will increase, and misery and poverty will be multiplied, Had we not better let charity begin at home, and endeavor to establish an institu tion which will far exceed compound interest in the return made on the expense jof establishing and maintaining it. And I having clothed, fed, and healed our naked, hungry, and diseased, then if we have any thing over, we can expend it upon others. Are we not told that "" he who provides not for those of his own household is worse than an infidel ?"" May not this also apply i to communities? —Yours, &c., James Irving, M.D.",LetterToEditor

Some scattered in seven years' traces, As they fell from the boy thafc'waß then ; Long left among idle green places, Or gathered but now among men ; On Beas full of wonder and peril, Blown white round the capes of the north ; Or in islands where myrtles are sterile And loves bring not forth. O daughters of dreams and of stories That life is not wearied of yet, Fauafciae, Fragoletta, Dolores, Felise, and Yolande, and Juliette, Shall I find you not still, shall I miss you, When sleep, that is true or that seems, Comes back to me hopeless to kiss you, O daughters of dreams ?

Is there place in the land of your labour, Is there room in your world of delight, Where change has not sorrow for neighbour And day has not night ? In their wings though the sea-wind yeb quivers, Will you spare not a space for them there, Made green with the running of rivers And gracious with temperate air ; In the fields and the turreted cities, That cover from sunshine and rain Fair passions and bountiful pities And loves without stain ?

Though the world of your hands be more gracious, And lovelier in lordship of things, Clothed round by sweet art with the spacious Warm heaven of her imminent wings, Let them enter, unfledged and nigh fainting, For the love of old loves and lost times ; And receive in your palace of painting This revel of rhymes. Though the seasons of men full of losses Make empty the years full of youth, If but one thing be constant in crosses, Change lays not her hand upon truth ; Hopes die, and their tombs are for token That the grief as the joy of them ends Ere time that breaks all men has broken The faith between friends.

The •on, that has scorched so fiercely the live long day, has sunk to rest—and the song of the birds among the rich tropical foliage of trees is hushed. In a small clearing a tent is pitched, while hard by are picketed a waggon and a couple of Cape oxen. Grouped around the fire that is burning brightly near the tent, are the figures of two men and a girl—busily engaged in dis cussing their tea. The elder of the two men has a healthy Anglo Saxon colour under his sunburn, and heavily bearded and weather beaten as he is, it is easy to see that he has been some years in South Africa. The younger man is also bearded, but more swarthy, and of a rather un-English type of countenance. Both are dressed in the easy-fitting home spun garments peculiar to settlers, and the younger wears a heavy cartridge-belt. As for the gtrl, she is, so far as one can judge, about nineteen years of age, and she bears astrikingresembiai.ee to the elder of her two companions. She is simply attired in a dress of light blue cotton, which shows off her supple figure to advantage. With out being exactly a pretty face, her- is one of rare earue-tness of expression, and it is lit up by a pair of lovelv dark violet eyes Her snarly head is crowned by plaits of reddish-brown hair, which is fitfully illumined by the flashing of the fire. At resent, she sits in a reverie, slowly sipping her tea,her eyes fixed with a far away look, open the darkening palm-trees. From tins sta:e she is aroused with a start by the voice of one of her companions addressing her. "" We must be up with the sun in the morning, Nifca,"" sa)s the elder of the two men. ■' Petre tells me that the Boers have risen in real earne-t, and I am anxious for us to reach Atchefstrom as soon as we pos sibly can. Is it not so Petre ?"" "" Yes, - ' chimes in the other, ""I am in deed well assured that the Transvaal will be in an uproar in a day or two, Meinheer— perhaps to-morrow, certainly next day. It is a feeling that has been smouldering ever since your English friends "" annexed the Transvaal,"" as they were please to term it, three years ago, and who shall say that my countrymen are not in the right !"" "" Why, / tell you so very distinctly, Mr. Vansittart !"" replies the young girl, her eyes flashing angrily at his words. "" I should have imagined that every sensible person ""—cuttingly—' would admit the wisdom of the British rule. Why, they have removed Cetewayo, whose reign was a constant menace to the Transvaal—they have prevented the Zulus from either cut ting each other's throats or those of the English and Dutch settlers—and I think that they are a miserably ungratfeul 'ot, whereas they ought to be grateful to the English for having stepped in !"" ""Softly, softly, Fraulein Nita,"" res[>onds he who is addressed as "" Mr. Vansittart."" "" Methinks the English have had enough oat of South Africa already—surely they had been wise to clear out of the Colony without making any trouble about it."" ** Well,well,"" interrupts the first speaker at this juncture,""l'll go tell Dick to inspan the oxen at sunrise ; then I'm going to turn in and leave you two people to tight it out —Good-night, Vansittart,"" he adds cheerily, and kissing his daughter, he strides a*ay to where a Koffir servant is attending to the two oxen. Left to themselves the young girl and her Dutch companion do not pursue the theme of their recent conversation. A silence falls upon them, which Petre Vansittart is the first to break. He asks, suddenly, ""Have you seen lately the Englishman, Harold Rothery, fraulein ?"" "" We had a letter from Captain Rothery, to say that he would be at Atehefstroin the day after to-morrow, and that he hoped to meet us there,"" responds the girl, flushing, and speaking rather constrainedly. The Dutchman is quick to note this same constraint. "" Look you, fraulein,"" he says, speaking rapidly and ajitatedly. ""All the Transvaal will be 'up' ere you can reach Atchefstrom, and you and your worthy father, what is to become of you ? This Captain Rothery, in whom you are so much interested, how can he aid you—what good, what assistance can he render you, when the English will be as surely driven out of Natal as-as we are sitting here ? Much better it will be, fraulein, for you and for all, if you will consent to commit your happiness to my hands-for I love you, Nita. I love you passionately—as you have never been loved before, as will never be loved again ! Yes, 1 swear it. Ah ! you turn away well, it is true I have told you this before ; but consent to be my wife, fraulein, and all shall be smoothed away. If not—well, after all, your English captain is at the best but a man of straw !"" Nita responds with a chilling dignity. "" Do you presume to threaten me, Mr. Vansittart ? If so, it is not well done. With regard to the proposal with which you have previously honoured me *'—sarca-- tically—""l tell you now as I told you then, that I do not love you and it cannot be. A 9 for Captain Rothery, he has been most kind and courteous to me aril to my father ; and that being so, I can only regret that you should have thoughtit worth u hde to disparage a man whom you scarcely know, and can, therefore, have nothing against !"" As -he leaves off speaking, with a bright flush and quiet air of dignity, Petre Van eittart begins to think that he ha« plav.d the wrong card in threatening this girl. But he is too enraged to curb himself now. "" Soh !"" he hi-.-es between his clenched teeth. "" you think von can .-r-t me at defiance, Nita Vincent' Hut beware, for 1 tell you that vou and your father are in greater danger thin you dream of. A- ioi your Englishman —ah ! so you blush for him, my lady ! What is your Kngli-h proverb, ' there is many a slip ?' '' And then hegoes awayhrough the d irk ness towards the tent, leaving t.'.e girl to cry a little, and wonder \ good deal as to the meaning of his menacing words. p re . eently she goes towards the waggon, and "" turns in "" for the night. Long after the camp is wrapt in slumber, the figure of Petre Vansittart, fully dressed, creep* stealthily out from the tent which he shares with Mr. Vincent, and is speedily lost in 'lie black darkness of that African forest. It is the dawn of Christmas Day, ls*l. a • • • • A few vear> before, Mr. Vincent, a well to-do Kngli-'i widower, and his only child, Nita, had come out to the Cape, and lining the life, had elected to sta>. They had roamed about the country a pood deal, doing a little farming in a desultory fashion ; and as his daughter was now nine teen years of age, M*. Vincent had serious thoughts of turning his steps towards civilisation once more, when, towaids the close of the year 1880, his resolve was inter rupted by the sudden rising of the Boer [wpulation against British iu!e in the Transvaal One of Mr. Vincent's few acquaintances was a Dutchman, Petre Van sittart by name, whose sympathies were all on the side of his countrymen, the Boer |>opulatioi). Vansittart, who, strange to say, was instinctively disliked and dis trusted by Nita Vincent from the com mencement of their acquaintance, professed a strong admiration for the young English girl, and though already rejected by her more than once, he was persistent in declin ing to take '' No "" for an answer. The gentleman referred to as Captain Rotherv was nit really a regular soldier, but an officer ot the Cape Mounted Rifles. On one or two occasions Harold Kothery was able to be of some slight service to Mr. Vincent and his d lighter ; but the latter's Dutch admirer made a great mistake in choosing as one of his weapons wherewith to tight her, her interest in the young officer. On awakening next morning the Vincents we re much astonished to rind that tneir travelling companion Vansittart had "" folded his tents like the Arab, and as silently stolen away,"" leaving no trace be hind him. "" Did you quarrel with him last night, Nita ?"" enquired that young lady's father, and Nita evasively replied that she had not. However, as there was no earthly good to be derived from waiting, since the truant had evidently deliberately left) them, the cavalcade started at sunrise upon the long journey that siill separated them from tiie town ot Atchefstrom. The party now con sisted only of three person.-—Mr. Vicnent, NiU, and the Kaffir servant. Slow progress was made in the scorching heat, across the Veldt, till about mid-day the waggon was suddenly surrounded, and its occupants made prisoners, by a party of armed and mounted Boers. No actual violence was offered them, they were simply seized, but on Mr. Vincent en quiring in Dutch what was the meaning of this outrage, a man stepped out from among their captors and disclosed the well known features of—Petre Vansittart ! "" Good morrow, meinheer ! (iood mor row, frauleiu !"" exclaimed their sometime friend, gaily. "" A pleasant Christmas to you. It is only that lam instructed by our General to intercept all British subjects travelling over the road to Atchefstrom. I am sorry to cause you inconvenience, meinheer."" A- he uttered the lie, an ugly smile flickered across the Boer's face. Nita and her father gave him manv contemptuous looks, though they answered little ; but when they were separated, placed under different guards, and the party began to move away from the direction of Atchefstrom, Mr. Vincent thought it was time to utter a pro test. ""My good raeinheer,"" retorted Vansit tart, looking with unconcern at the friend whom he had betrayed,"" you make too much of this misfortune—l beg you look at it philosophically, and believe that it is merely the ' fortune of war.' Meanwhile, I will go and make amends to your charm ing daughter."" And he actually persisted in riding by the side of Nita, taunting her with her change of position, and reminding her that the '• English Captain '' was not at hand to aid her. In two or three hours' time they had put miles between them and Atchefstrom —in the wrong direction, as the Vincents sorrowfully told themselves. But ""it is the unexpected that happens ;' and after three or four hours of this journey ing over the veldt a fresh turn of fortune's wheel set the captives at liberty again ! For a party of the Cape Mounted Rifles |)erceived the cavalcade from afar, bore down upon it, and, as soon as they under stood the position of affairs, made prisoners of some of the Boers and scattered the remainder. Strangely and pleasantly enough, Captain Harold Rothery proved to be in command of the Rifles, and very glad were Mr. Vincent and Xita—especially Nita —to shake their friend and deliverer by the hand. He was a handsome fellow, and greatly interested did he appear in Nita. The three of them partook of some food together, and quite a merry little party were they. what wonder if the gallant Captain uttered words of love to Nita ? Circumstances had conspired to make hnn not altogether indifferent to her, and as she lay in his arms with his kisses fresh upon her lips, she thought thut life could hold little better for her than to get back to civilisation and become the wife of tins man. She knew that her father would not disapprove. It was arranged between them that Nita and her father should travel on to Atchef stroin, and thence by e.ssy stages to Cape Town guarded duiing lh ■ dangerous part of tiie journey by the Mounted Rifles. I should have said that I't tie Vansittart was among the captured Boer? ; but it was dis covered, greatly to the consternation of the Vincents and Harold Rothery, that nothing could be proved against him sufficient to warrant his detention, especially as he avowed that the idea was not to capture the Vincents, but simply to e.-cort them to ihe frontier. He carried with him certain p.i|iers and passports, indeed, which com pelled them to release him. Then Vansittart spoke to Captain Kotherv, an evl light gleaming in ins eyes. ""You love the Fruilein Vincent,l believe':"" he asked. Harold Lov»el coldly. "" She i.- to become uu v. it..',' ho sud briefly. • I think not, nn-inhccr,' 1 retorted the other, sneeringly.

But he too could shoot straight and well on occasion ; and it was his firm inten tion to save the woman he loved so dearly from a fate wor-e than death itself.

"" Where are you going, Jack ? "" ""Fishing* father."" "" Oh ! and what do you expect to catch ? "" ""Why, fish to be sure, father,"" ""Oh!"" Jack had been told many times over that he would catch no fish in that spot, but he thought he knew best. So Jack went down to the rivor and seated himself on the bank, with his legs dangling over the stream, and threw his line in and waited. Tho water-lilies lay among thoir green leaves at bis foet, looking up at him as if they were say?ng, "" Do you really moanit, Jack ? Do you really expect to catch a fish ?"" ""Yes, I Jdo,"" said Jack,, pettishly, answer ing what they seemed to say, whether they said it or not ; and just then down went bis float under water, "" There 1"" cried Jack in triumph; and in his eagerness he gave his rod a very sharp jerk, Snap went hi 3 line. That was provoking ! It must have been a big fish. Jack felt angry at first, but presently be folt proud to go home and boast that he had hooked auch a bipf fish that it had gone of with his line. There was no doubt that he knew best after all. Tha next evening away he went again to the same spot, and again he seated himself with his legs dangling over the water. *' Where are you going, my boy ?"" his father had called after him as ho set out. "" Fishing, father."" ""And what do you expect to catch to night?"" "" Why, another big fish of course, father."" Jack chuckled over this somewhat saucy answer. As ho sat upon the bank watching his float there lay the lilies still, gazing up placidly into his face. Down went his float. ""There!"" Jack jerked his rod more warily this time ; then, as the great fish seemed to pull hard, he slackened ; and then, when it grew quieter, he began to haul in his line. Snap went the line in another moment. Jack knelt on the bank and leant over the water in dismay. The lilies were nodding at him in quite a state of agitation. They seemed to be saying, "" I told you so, Jack ; I told you so ! "" just as his grandmother did whenever he got into trouble. ""You didn't ! you never said a word about it !"" cried Jack, affronted at what they seemed to say ; and he ahoulderod his rod and marohed off home. ""Another big fish, my boy?"" said bis father, with a knowing smile which Jack did not quite like, and did not at all understand ; but nis brothers and sisters thought him a most wouderful fisherman, and that made amends ; and he felt that he knew best after all. It seemed, however, as if Jack had had sport enough, for he did not go down to the river the next evening, nor yet the next, nor yet the next, the truth being, poor boy ! tbat he had lost bis lines and his hooks and could not get any more. By-and-bye, a little while after this, Jack's father was sent with some othev men to look to some decayed posts and the old planking tbat supported the river bank. Jack went to look on. He felt rather a great man down there where ho had done such wonders. One old post was dragged out of the river and laid upon the bank that a new and sound one might be put in its place. "" What's this I "" said one of the men ; for in the soft part of the wood there was a fkhhook and a piece of line attached to it. Jack's father smiled his knowing smile again, and bending down cut out the hook ; then he tossed it to Jack. ""Look here! what's this?"" oried another man presently, as in casting aside a lot of lilies and water-weed he found it all bound to gether with a tangle of string, and something sharp prioked his hand. Jack's father looked knowing once more; cut the line and tossed it to Jack ; upon which Jack grew very red and ran home. One day not long after this Jack was giving himself some airs to his mother. ""That isn't the way to light the fire,"" she had said ; but Jack thought be knew best. "" Gome hither, my boy,"" said his father, "" and listen to me, There was once a lad who knew better than anyone else ; he knew he could natch fish down there in the bend of the river amongst the weeds ; so he went, and what do you think he caught ? "" Than Jack hung his head, and lighted the fire in his mother's way; for he knew now what you and I guessed long ago, no doubt that bis two big fish were, the one an old post and the other a water lily,— lllustrated Chris tian Weekly, LETTERS FROM LITTLE FOLKS.

There was a table set out under a tree in front of a home, and a March Hare and a Hatter were having tea at it. A Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep,, and the othertwo were using it asacushion, restingtheir elbows on it and talking over its head. "" Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,"" thought Alice } "" only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind."" The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it. ""No room ! no room ! "" they cried out when they saw Alice coming, "" Tbere'B plenty of room,"" said Alice, indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one end of the table. ""Have some wine,"" the March Hare said in an encouraging tone, Alioe looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it but tea, I don't see any wine,"" she remarked, "" There ain't any,"" said the March Hare. ""Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,"" said Alice, angrily. "" It wasn't very civil of you to sit down with out being invited,"" eaid the March Hare. "" I didn't know it was your table,"" said Alice ; ""it's laid for a great many more than three."" "" Your hair wants cutting,"" said the Hatter, He had been looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity. This was bis fret speech. "" You should learn not to make per sonal remarks,"" said Alice, with some severity ; "" it's very rude."" The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this, but all be said was, ""Why is a raven like a writing desk ?"" ""Come, we shall havo some fun now,"" thought Alice.

I knew by the sympathetic glow upon his bald head—l knew by the thoughtful look upon his face—l knew by the emo"" tional flush upon the strawberry end of the old free-liver’s nose, that Simon Wheeler’s memory was busy wi:h the old time. And so I prepared to leave, for all these were symptoms of a reminiscence— signs that he was going to be delivered of another of hia tiresome personal ex periences—but I was too slow ; he got the start of me. As nearly as I can recollect, the infliction was couched in the following language : “ We were all boys then, and didn’t care for nothing, and didn’t have any trouble, and didn’t worry about nothing only to shirk school and keep up a re vivin’ state of devilment ail the time. This yah Jim Wolf 1 was talkin’about was the ’prentice, and he was the best hearted feller, lie was, and the most forgivin’ and onsellish I ever see—well, there could not be a more bullior boy than he was, take him how you would, and sorry enough was I when I see him for the last time. “ Me and Henry was always pestering him, and plastering horsebills on his hack and putting bumble bees in his bed, and so on, qnd sometimes we’d crowd in and bunk with him, notwithstanding his growling, and then we’d let on to get mad and fight across him, so as to keep him stirred up like. Ho was nineteen, he was, and long, and lank, and bashful, and we was fifteen and sixteen, and tolerably lazy and worthless. “ So, that night, yon know, that my sister Mary gave a candy pullin’, they started us to bed early so as the company could have full swing, and we run in on Jim to have some fun. “ Our winder looked out onto the roof of an ell, and about ten o’clock a couple of old tom cats got to runnin’ and chargin around it, and carryin’ on like mad. '1 here was four inches of snow on the roof, and it was frozen, so that there was a right smart crust of ice on it, and the moon was shinin’ bright and we could see them cats like daylight. First they would stand off and e-yow, yow, yow, just the same as they was scoldin’ one another, you know, and how up their hacks and push up their tails and swell round and spit ; then all of a sudden the grey cat ’ud snatch a handful of hair from the yallow cat’s ham, and spin round him like the button on a barn door. But the yaller cat was game, and he’d come and clinch, and the way they’d make the fur fly W'as powerful. “ Well, Jim, he got disgusted with the row, and ’lowed he’d climb out there and shake ’em ofl’n that roof. He hadn’t reely no intention of doin’ it, likely, but we ever lastin’ly dogged him, and bullyragged him, and ’lowed he’d always bragged how he would not take a dare, and so on, and lo and behold yon, he went—went exactly as he was—nothin’ on but a shirt, and that was short. But you ought to see him. You ought to see him creeping over that ice, and diggin’ his toe nails and finger nails in to keep from slippin’, and ’bove all you ought to have seen that shirt-tail a-flappin’ in the wind, and them long, ridiculous shanks of his a glistenin’ in the moonlight. “ Them company folks were down there under the eaves, the whole squad of them under the ornery shed of old Washin’ton Bower vines—all sett’n round about two dozen sassers of hot candy, which they’d set in the snow to cool. And they was laughin’ and talkin’ lively ; but bless you, they didn’t know nothin’ about the pano rama that was goin’ on over their heads. Well, Jim, he went a sneakin’ up unbe known to them cats—they was a swishin’ their tails and yow-yowin’ and threatenin’ to clinch, you know, and not payin’ any attention—he went a sneakin’ right up to the comb of the roof, till he was in a foot and a half of ’em, and then all of a sudden he made a grab for the yaller cat ! But bj r gosh, he missed fire and slipped his holt, and his heels flew up and he flopped on his back, and shot ofl”n that roof like a dart, went a slashin and a crushin’ down through them old rusty vines and landed right in the dead centre of them company people— sot down like a ycarthquake in them two dozen sassers of red-hot candy, and let of a howl that was hark f’m thetonih ! Them gals—well, they looked you know. They sec ho wasn’t dressed for company, and so they left. All done in a second, it was just one little war ■whoop, and a swish of their dresses, and nary the wench of ’eiu w'as in sight anywhere. “ Jim, he was a sight. He was gormed with that bilin’ hot molasses candy clean down to his heels, and had more busted sassers bangin' to him than if he was an Injun princess—and he came a prancin’ up stairs just a whoopin’ and ragin’, and every jump he gave ho shed some china, and every squirm he fetched he dropped some can cl v ! “ And blistered !

As the digger .held the two horses, wondering at the delay of his gueata, a low cry of pain pierced the noon-day still ness, and Walter Alleyne appeared, who made him a sign to secure the animals and come to him at once. , •< Tom obeyed, and heard from the lips of the surgeon a story, which greatly astonished him — a story, of tragic in terest connecting the dead man in his hut with the fair woman who had so./unex-' pectedly appeared on the scene, to nurse 1 and soothe his dying hours. - Walter told the heads of the story as concisely and quickly as possible ; Long Tom listened attentively, and without spoken comment, yet when he hoard of the hiding-place in the wall, . the Yankee uttered a low .whistle of astonishment.. However often it may recur, it is always a cause of new surprise to us to find, that, we have only touched the surface of the* lives of those with whom we have been living on terms of close intimacy; that underneath the well-known . exterior lie pits and chasms utterly unsuspected by vs — gears of old unhealed wounds,. secret sins, haunting terrors — . fears, . . hopes, aspirations, in which we have no share.; and all so far removed from our precon ceived impressions, that the , real man thus revealed is indeed a stranger, utterly different from the person we had sup posed him to be and to have been. And we ask ourselves, Can this be my friend, my brother, or my son 1 as the case may be. The nearest, the dearest, the closest in blood and friendship, are thus in the deepest sense "" strangers yet ;"" and .' /; Not even, the ten derest heart, and next oar own, Knows half the reasons why we smile and sigh., i The Yankee listened, waiting for that part of the story which should concern himself, and discover the motive which had induced Walter io relate it to, him.- When he heard that, the bottle containing the important paper had been. lost,. .then: he understood why the tale had been told;: "" Gone, is . it 9"" he echoed, . and stood for a moment lost in thought ; then, slap* ping his leg, he cried with sudden energy, \ ""Ah I I have it now. That tarnation: ole 'coon of a yaller skin, that ♦ heathen Chinee,' is at the bottom of thin. He must have heard .what George said ; or, more like, watched Mrs Leydon herself;: and thought to make a grand haul. And, now. I think of it, I ain't' had a sight of the ole cuss, this morning ; and that alone is suspicious.

We'll soon put this straight."" . . The Yankee strode off to the rear of the hut, and a dozen long- steps brought him to the Chinaman's tent— a structure so Bmall that it was matter for surprise that the Mongolian contrived to shelter his whole person within it, instead of leaving his head or his feet, or both extremities, protruding on either side. Tom lifted the dirty flap, and looked in. The Celestial, apparently asleep, lay curled up like a dog ; his head resting on & small tea-chest, round which one arm was tightly clasped. . >< , . . .The Yankee touched him with his foot, as he would have roused a sleeping cur. * < "" Git out of that, you ole skunk,"" he said, ""and don't try to play .'possum with me. You're no more asleep than I am."" The Chinaman moved, and pretended to awake, rubbing his eyes and muttering' some inarticulate excuses. •,- • r -. '■ Tom's patience — of which, it: must be confessed that he possessed no very .large supply — was now exhausted. > He seized -the man by the collar, and half-lifted, lialf-dragged him from his - lair. The wretched creature did not attempt .to. resist, but tightening bis.hold on the box,', suffered his captor to shake him as a big dog shakes a rat ; and, when it was over, essayed to creep back into his den. But this did not suit the Yankee's notions. . • i ."" Hark yon, Johnny,"": he cried, "" you won't pull wool over my eyes ; I'm! too old a stager for that. You darned ole cuss, I've euchred you ; no knuckle under, and look pleasant. Disgorge your ill gotten plunder, or "" The pause was significant, and needed no expletives to strike terror into the craven heart of the Chinaman, who, with vehement gesticula tions, denied any knowledge of the Yankee's meaning, and when plainly accused of the theft, loudly declared his innocence ; but the Yankee was too wise to believe him. ""Hand me over that box,"" he said, suddenly; "" and let me see what you have got in it."" ""Tea, tea — muchy tea — good tea,"" cried the other, interposing his own body as a shield between the cariosity of • the digger and the object that he held tighter than ever, now that there seemed danger of losing it. .' • ,/ , Then Tom expressed his determination to examine the box, enforcing his words •with a few round oaths more strong than elegant ; and then paused, in utter con fusion, when he saw that Walter had fol lowed him, and that Stella was standing by his side. • ' •The lady was still pale, bat had re •covered some degree of outward serenity; for Walter had told her that the digger was confident in his ability to recover her ' lost treasure. Now, as she saw the miser able, cringing Chinaman in the grasp of the athletic American, whose sinewy arms lifted him from the ground without any apparent effort, and seemed capable of crushing out his life as one crashes a nut, she earnestly entreated the digger ""not to hurt the poor man."" •' ' - j ""He is so weak, and you are so strong,"" she added, with that perfection of uncon Scious art which we' Call tact. ' ""Hurt him!"" echoed Tom, with much scorn, yet propitiated by the compliment to his prowess, and insensibly relaxing his grasp — ""You can't hurt him; he's like an eel, he's got no bones."" Then, addressing the quaking, specimen of humanity, 'he continued, ""Now, you jailer thief, do you mean 1 to give me that box, or do you not ? I reckon you had best do it."" . : The small cunning eyes looked fur tively ' round, -seeking an avenue for escape j but found 'none. Another shake 'from Tom hurried the decision ;and again protesting that there was nothing in the box but tea, the Celes tial removed the cover, and' stood by stolid as ever. I 'At first sight, it appeared as if he had, only spoken the truth — the chest was half full of tea. - For a moment the Yankee ' was baffled ; then his quick eye caught the leer of satisfied greed with which the ■ suspected man wa3 about to replace the lid. f ""Stop a bit!"" cried Tom, and whipping, op his shirt-sleeve, he thrust his arm, elbow deep, into the fragrant mass. ! With something between a whine and a yell, 1 the Ghinaman tried to throw him self over the box. Tom caught him, and held him back with his left hand, while he continued th 9 search with his right. All at 'once he drew back, and tossed something towards Mrs Leydon. ; ""Js *that yours ?"" he said. I Walter caught it, and gave it to her. i 'A small,' tight roll of note-paper, tied, sealed, and directed to ""Mrs Stella Ley i Stella seized it with a cry of delight, and thrust it into the bosom of her habit.

A heavy mist shrouded Manhattan I lacd one November morning in the year 1776, breaking occasionally into stinging showers of Tain. From the season and the weather tha landscape was forbidding enough, and on hill and valley, in forest and open, the depressing «ffsoE was intensified by the traces of recent desperate fighting. Considering the short, •harp struggle of two days before, in the dis passionate spirit possible after the lapse of a osntury, we oannot but consider it one of the most hearl-siokening on reoord, bsoause we know that the issue must hive been to both fides a foregone conolusi •■■ >rom the, first. Tor hours a thousand tan- ■>- more had been pushing through the mist irom Fort Wash ington and Harlem Height* toward the city of New York, the limits of which were defined by rude barricades, called by courtesy forti fications, thrown out from Butgers Farm on the east to Bayard's Mount, and westward to the Hudson. The men in the outside columns of this straggling line appeared in the distance like long scarlet cords hedging in a motley orew of dark crooked figures. On nearer view the <jord divided, and eaoh red-coat«d, well appointed British soldier stood out distinctly. This division of the line marohed lightly over the rough, wet ground, adding to a trained step a swagger indicative of the elation of the conqueror. The centre of the line offered the wretched spectacle of soldiers without arms, •oldiers in various uniforms, from rough hunting jaokots to the blue and buff of the Continental army ; many wounded, many tagged and dirty— all alike miserable and humiliated— prisoners of war. At a little stone ohuroh situated on an eminence commanding tho Bsst Biver a halt was called, and a doien men or mere, dis tinguuhabla from their fellow-iufferera by a •word at the side, went into the ohnreh to sign the parole offered by K>""£ George to the gentlemen ia command of »•-. bol troops taken prisoners in war. The oath having been read aloud, several officers signed in dogged silenoe, with frown ing faces. The fleshy scarlet and gold representative of victory, standing by the register, scruti nising signatures and signers with an air of onimpeaohable superiority, palled : ""Hugh Forrest, Captain, commanding Company F of the Second New lork Begi ment of the Continental Army."" All eyes turned toward a man leaning against the stone wall somewhat apart from his comrades. He had taken this position on entering, and stood with his arms folded and his head bant. His coat had lost the left sleeve, and the blood-stained bandages round his arm told one of the minor inoidents of battle. In answer to bis name he neither looked up nor moved, and it was doubtful if he had hnnrd. "" Don't you heir, you damned rasoally rebel t Hurry up !"" These words were spoken, in Fovresl'a ear, and he started as if struok In an unseen hand. He lifted his head quickly, and aeoing at his elbow a man in whose face cruelty, arrogance, and impudence were all combined, his unhurt right arm flew out, and his neighbour went down on the stone floor in a heap like a felled •x. • The blow had been seen and the fall, and ■ow, in this edifice dedicated to God's service, were heard the olatter of swords pulled from the scabbard, savage shouts of ""Bebel!"" "" Dastard!"" ""Cur!"" and twenty valiant armed mtn rushed at one, wounded and de fenceless. Forrest stood still, with his arms folded again. His head was held high enough now, and he looked at the crowd of angry men with a scorn and hatred little calculated to appease them. In eleven years, passed mostly in worrying politioal controversy, and in the anticipation of war and preparation for it, his face had lost the delioaoy of youth. The glowing enthusiasm of his earlier years had disappeared, too, along with dear hopes and atill dearer illusions. Mia features were heavier, and his 'expression, when calm, had the severity noticeable inmon whose thoughts are serious and deeds vigoro . a. His f aca was browned, too, from exposure, and just now dark with passion. If the whole British army had fallen upon him then, he would have died scowling and oursing it with his last breath. Before a blow had been struok, the spirit of military discipline asserted itself, and a peremptory command from the major at the. register sent every sword olioking back in the scabbard, and brought every avenger to a standstill. The upshot of this unexpected disturbance was that Hugh Forrest was marched to New York under special guard. His wounded arm and the arm that had itruok an honourable British offioer were tied together behind his back, and it was supposed that he wonld await in oloie confinement the ■entenoe whioh General Howe and Council should deem fitting for so. black a rebel. In the satirioal and truly humourous account of the entry of the ""colonist sol diers"" iota the city whioh appeared in the Sew York Qotette the day following, the anoident in the ohuroh was narrated in spicy style. Before General Howp had heard his name, Forrest was condemn? i to ignominious death by outraged Tory opin m. In the dining-room of Chilip Alstyne's house two people were talking the matter «ver, each trying to convert the other to his way of thinking. Alstyne sat in a high* backed ohair, and the fite -light playing over his face revealed but slight trace of the ad vanoing years. Perhaps time had been too pleasantly busy with Kate Alstyne to bother about an old man. She had grown into an indisputably beautiful young woman, and was the only human being that Philip Alstyne had ever been able to love. Miss Alstyne was quite conscious of her power over her father's heart, and though oontrary te our accepted traditions concerning girls of her period, she knew well that that power was •even stronger over the hearts of other men. As she stood faring him, Alstyne was think ing how like she was to a boy who had raved •of liberty where she now was denouncing the tyranny that had brought that bo? a prisoner into the city of his birth, 1 and lodged him among felons and murderorn. The fire-light:, too, brought oat golden life's in her browa hair as it had in his, and th • r^alled the past more forcibly, as trifles will, * hioh stay in the memory long after greater th < . iss are forgotten . Her bluo eves burned as hi* dark eyes had, her voice echoed his defianc -, and her hands, grasping ft crumpled paper, expressed, as his had, the inability of any power to loosen the grip on what they chose to hold. ""Itis a most infamous oharge, papa. The honour of oar family is attaoked, and I look to you to see that Cousin Hugh be releasad at once."" She looked imperiously at her father, and Alstyne, casting down his eyes as of old, hesi tated. "" Why do you hesitate, papa'P You can tear Cousin Hagb, who you know well is as true a gentleman as ever breathed, be he patriot or royalist, denounced as a cowardly brute soaroe fit for the gallons, and hesitate. You oan road Ensign Grey's words, ' The attack was without provocation, and therefore cannot be explained by me,' and hesitate to denounce the lie. ■ I know the circumstances no more than you, but I will wager that Hugh Forrsst struok that blow in answer to a deadly insult, and that Ensign Grey knows well tho nature of that insult— no man wetter. Miss Alstyne's breath came quiokly, and her fingers were playing destruction with the email newspaper sheet. Alstyne smiled and answered with polished courtesy. "" Anger becomes you, Kate. The rebel Forrest might die happy oould he see how his misfortunes rouse beauty to his de fence."" "" The rebel— Fomst ! "" she cried, in bewil dered surprise. ""Has it come to that?"" She sank down in a chair, and covered her face, with her hands. ""And why not, Kate?"" Alrtyna con tinued, placidly. "" His namn is Forrest, and lie is a rebel, seeing that he has taken up •rat against the King— God nave him ! And I tell you, Kate, the less you think of the rebel Forrest and cattle of his kind the better for you. If it pleases you to indulge in womanish i anting at home, it hurts neither you nor me, but go outside and do it and you hurt us both. More, you risk my displea ours, and you little know, you spoiled child, what that means. In this matter of the vebel Forrest, he may rot in a dungeon or hang on the tallows j I shall not lift my hand lo sue him."" l-jj Miss Alstyne sat with her face hidden for full five minutes, then she went to her father and put her hands on his shoulders and looked at him sweetly. ""Papa, if 1 wero doomed to death for a great crime, a orime even in your eyes, and it lay in your power to save me, would you not save me?"" "" You oan do no evil, Sate, save with your bright eyes, and suoh crimes do not come within oogaiianoe of the law."" "" But if I should, papa ? Imagine. If I should P"" t ..,. A "" Then, for the sake of peace, ohud, there is no orime you oould commit from the con sequences of which I would not save you with my own life."" She sat down on his knee, and laid Her head on his shoulder, and wound her arms round his neok. There was a silenoe long enough for Alstyne to realise how dear his daughter was to him, and to hope that her violent speeoh had meant no more than sympathy with the friend of her childhood —had been but a tempest of girlish passion. "" Papa, I am thinking about mamma. How lonely I was in England when she died! "" • , 11 It was a sorry time for you."" "" Ludlow was with his regiment, and Jaok buried in his books at Oxford."" "" Well, well, those days are gone by. You will not be alone again, my daughter."" Ahtyne's hand trembled as ho stroked her hair. "" The rebel Forrest was there, papa."" "" I remember. At home with a pack of petitioning hounds, hoping to Overreach Par liament."" ""He was kind to me, papa. He comforted me then."" Alstjne'a arms loosened their hold of her ""Kind in small things, oruel in great. At that hour he was planning a revolution, planning to destroy your home and ruin your inheritance."" ""His own as well, then, papa. So him that scant justice. None have suffered more than he for our people. Papa, out of regard for past kindness, it would beoome the gen tleman yeu are to make a plea to General Howe in behalf of the rebel Forrest."" ""You have had my deoisioD, Kate. He has by his own act nullified the past. No more, pray."" , Alstyne's voice was not harsh, but had a measured coldness which he had never before adopted towards his daughter. "" Papa, you have said that at the cost of your own life you would save me from the oonsequenoes of crime. I ask you for what is dearer to me than my own life — the life of the man I love."" She slipped to the ground, and held her father's hand. ""I love him. He played with me when I was a child. He comforted me when my mother died. He asked me then if I was far him and liberty still, and I said, 'Ay. 1 Then he asked, • Forever ?' and 1 said ' ForoTer.' Then he said, * You may yet waver, Kate, but if ever I am untrne to our country or to you, may I die a coward's death !' Papa, papa, his dis graoe is my disgrace, his life is my life, his death is my death."" As Philip Alstyne listened, his eyes con traoted and his mouth hardened visibly. He pushed his daughter roughly aiide, and rose. ""Then, presumably, he has been false to you, Miss Catherine Alstyne, since we know him true to his precious country, and know too that he is about to die a coward's death. Shall die, I sayi At least I may save my daughter the shame of being pointed at as a woman who feigned love for a principle to screen her love for a man."" His words struck deep, as he meant they should. She stood vp k her face blazing with wrath and shame. ""Ie has been lef 6 for my father who loves me to insult me. If deeds oan annul the memory and obligations of the past, words also can do that work. But of this be assured— as long as one Alstyne lives, Hugh Forrest shall neither rot in a dungeon, nor hang on a gallows, nor die any coward's death. I give you fair warning."" Miss Alstyne walked out of the room, and the sharp oliok of her high heels eohoing in the hall and on tho Btaira seemed to her father to ring back to him her bitter resent ment for the insult effered to her maidenly dignity. He stood long looking into the fire, and at last, having called for writing materials, indited a letter to one Captain Hall, engaging passage for Miss Alstyne and her maid by the next English paoket.

"" How,"" thought I, "" will one brought up in the lap of luxury aa George Wataon has been relish the change 1 "" Letters followed frequently enough, for a time, giving gloomy accounts of my friend's small fortunes, and then for months a dead silence. I wrote and re wrote, but still no answer. At last a letter came. It was only a few words :—: — "" Dear Bill,— l am in great distress. I do not like to trouble you, but a couple of pounds would be a great boon. I have been ill for the last couple of months — have attempted to see my father, but in vain. Maggie is also very far from well since she had her baby, of whose birth I had neglected to apprise you."" I waa very poor, but my two pounds wero, of course, at my friend's service, and I resolved to take the requested aid myself. The address was an obscure one — a close off Blackfriars street, City. As I threaded my way through the nasty purlieus I could not help thinking what a change from the stately lodging in Huddersfield Square. In a garret room lived my old comrade, George Watson. Filth inside and out, and he himself lay in bed liker death than life. His wife, emaciatad, and nurs ing a sickly-looking infant, sat by the ghost of a miserable fire, attired in the scantiest clothing. Her only greeting was a flood of tears. "" Cheer up, Geordie, old fellow,"" 1 said, briskly, trying to make my speech belie my thoughts. ""I am here, and only sorry that you did not write to me sooner."" ""It is very kind of you, Bill,"" he re plied. "" I would not have troubled you, but the landlord has threatened to dis train for the three months' rent we are owing."" I looked at the three ricketty chairs and the moth-eaten bedstead and table, and wondered what any one could find to distrain. "" We shall keep that evil away,"" said I. "" Meanwhile, you must have a nurse, and I will go out to your father this very day, or call at his office, which will be the better plan."" "" Thank you, Bill, but I fear that as regards my father that is a hopeless case."" Here Maggie began to weep anew, and I left hurriedly in quest of Messrs. Wat son & Co.'s office, taking care to leave the two pounds behind me. I found the office of Watson & Co. within a stone-throw of the Royal Ex change. The old gentleman, when I was ushered into his private office, expressed himself pleased to see me, and at once invited me out to dinner at Huddersfield Square, a pleasure I was obliged to decline. I briefly recapitulated \o him the events of the morning, and begged him if he could not receive him back into Mb family, at least to do something to mitigate his circumstances. "" I am sorry to say, William, allow me to call you by your Christian name as I have been used to do, that cannot be. My son on marrying that person expressly forfeited all claims on my sympathy. We had a distinct understanding on the matter."" ""I do not extenuate, Mr Watson,"" I replied, ""your son's marriage with the young woman whom he saw fit to make his'wife. If I had been consulted, I should have strongly advised him against it ; but now that the step cannot be recalled, I would have you think, sir, that he is your only son, and should be the comfort and prop of your old age, and in every other respect, 1 understand, he has been every thing that a son ought to be."" ""I am a man of my word, William, and cannot go back from it. I pointed out to my son the consequences of his folly, but he was wiser than I, and prefer red leaving his father's house and resign-, ing all the privileges which his position brought him. I cannot go back from my word ; but allow me to state that it is a pleasure to me to hear you expreas your self aa you have done. I had thought you had approved of my son's action, but am happy to have been under a miscon ception as to your views. "" I said good-bye, and hurried back to Blackfriars street to detail the results of my mission, a little disappointing, I con fess, to myself, but seemingly not to those for whom it had been undertaken. "" I knew how it would be, my dear Bill. There is no hope. My father spoke to me decidedly and calmly, and I do not believe that he will ever forego his resolution."" In the following events I was no parti cipator. They were supplied to me either by letter at the time, or communication afterwards. The reader will therefore be pleased to excuse whatever may appear crude or bald in the recital. Things grew worse and worse for Geordie and his wife. He was no sooner better than she fell ill, and his post he had forfeited by his long illness. He found it impossible to procure another with a salary which would support his wife, child, and himself, especially with the entailed expenses which nursing, medi cal bills, and the luxuries a sick person required. He did not frequently appeal to me, but being cognisant of his wantß, I sent whatever I was able to spare, and procured gifts of a pound or two besides from some of my intimates. Things were at the worst when he ao cidentally heard that hia father had been struck with paralysis, and that very small hopes were entertained of his recovery. George lost no time in running out — ragged and poverty-stricken as he was — to Hudderafield Square. But he met with a denial. The servants were in structed not to let him enter. Again and again he called, learning at the door that his father was sinking gradually — but he got no farther. Once, indeed, he en countered hia aunt, who offered him a shilling (which George refused), and bade him not come back, as hia father re solutely refused to see him, and even de sired his name not to be mentioned. My poor friend was at his wit's end — nothing availed him seemingly — when he hit upon a project, partly growing out of his wants, partly entertained with the forlorn tenacity of a last hope. Late one morning, accoutred in his usual dilapidated garb, through which the blast made itself felt, Geordie left the garret in Blackfriars street and made his way to Huddersfield Square. To think that ho who had been brought up there in all the luxury of an only son — heir to one of the great city magnates— should revisit it as a pauper! The <thbqght caused a choking sensation, but he quelled it. He must now do or die. He began a song — one of his father's favourites in early years. He hoped that even now it might reach his ears, "" rever berating upon a chord of ancient sym pathy,"" and awakening tenderness in the old man's heart :—: — 0 Mary, go and call the cattle home, Across the sands o' Dee. As the song proceeded, a few pedes trians, caught by the artistic rendering of the air, and the sweetness of the singer's voice, stopped to listen. A few coppers were thrown to him. Within, on the second flat, lay an old man near the point! of death. The song, too, reached his ears. "" My boy, my boy,"" cried.the old man; ""it is his voice. I know it, yoii rascal,"" he said to the astonished valet, ""why do you keep him standing there ? — ho ! — lend me your arm to the window— l will invite him myself."" '   In a second the window was opened, and George heard the well-known voice calling him. In a few minutes he was in his father's arms. v ""I will make reparation, my boy. James,"" addressing the valet, ""open that bureau ; give me my case."" The case was handed to him, and Mr Watson, looking over the contents for a moment, crumpled them together, and directed the servant to throw them in the fire-place. As they were flickering in the' chimney, the aunt entered the room. She\ bowed to George in stately silence, and addressing his father, asked if it was ""with his sanction that her ""nephew was there?"" . ,  "" Yes, sister, with my sanction,"" said the old man. "" I invited him, and, thank heaven, it was not too late. I Have' de stroyed my will ; and he is now as he was before, the heir of all I possess."" ' Old Mr Watson died a few days' after, ' days during which his son seldom left hia ' bedside. I received due intimation of the old gentleman's decease, and on repairing to Glagow was received by George and his wife at Huddersfield Square; My ' friend's aunt was now his dependant, but he behaved more liberally with her than, she had done with him, oijly it was scarcely convenient for any of the parties concerned that she should continue to live . at Huddersfield Square. ' George has now succeeded his father in business, and extended the large business of Watson and Co. into a still larger con cern. As for myself, if the reader cares to know anything about me, 1 am an Edinburgh medical man, with large prac tice and comparatively meagre einolu-'. ments. It is one of my chief delights when Geordie takes a run through to spend a couple of nights with me, or when I can snatch a holiday to spend with him and his family circle at Hud dersfield Square.",Fiction

I am well aware that on al! stations the rabbiter is looked upon as a necessary evil; yet without doubt, as long as the rabbits abound on the runs, so long will the rabbiter's un welcome presence be required to keep them in check. Granted, then, that the rabbiter is a necessary evil, is that any reason why he should not be as fairly and honourably treated aB any other of the employes on the different runs and stations ? Such, Sir, how ever, is unfortunately not the ca3e. lam sorry to state that many station owners, and especially station managers— particularly those of the latter who are employed by the leading firms of Otago- do not hesitate to stoop to the meanest tactics iv their endeavours to defraud— l cannot honestly apply any other term— the rabbiter out of his just dues. A3 a case in point allow me to Btate whit happened in the neighbourhood from which I write during the past winter. At the commencement of the season four gangs, comprising in all between 40 aud 50 men, were made up on a certain station. Different blocks of country, varying in size according to the number of men, were allocated to each gang. Ihe terms of the agreement, which each man was required to sign previous to his starting work, were as follows : —Poisoned grain to be delivered to the men by the station at 5s per 1001b (no stipulation as to the quality of the grain, or to the quantity of poison to be used per cwt.). Good skins to be paid for at the rate of £1 per 100; iDferior ones— please mark the word "" inferior ""—los per ICO. Rations at current rates, and the men to provide their own cooking utensils. Now, Sir, I look upon the above agree ment, stamped and signed by each individual, as a contract— a contract equally binding on the part of the manngement of the station as well as on that of the men. Before, however, the gangs had been out a week they had good reason to know that neither the agreement nor the honour of a station manager was to ba relied on. Tho men were then on high country in which the rabbita were very scarce. But rabbit-re, like iverjone else, have to take the bad with the good. Inaluded in the block al'ocated to a certain gang was a piece of low country on which the rabbits were very plentiful. Heie they expected to recoup themselves for the lo&t time and enforced idleness spent on the high country. Judge, then, of the feelings of each and all when word came to the camp that the manager had started trappers on the particular piece of ground on v hich their hopes relied. When remon strated with, tho manager excused himself on the plea that the inspectors h.id forced him to tliis measure. Now I know for a fact, Sir, that such was not the case, and that no rabbit inspector could be found insane enough to compel trapping on grouud where poisoning was to follow immediately, seeing that quietnes.B previous to poisoning is one of the principal requisites to ensure success. No, Sir, the reasoc why trappers were put on and kept on until the very day the m?n came on it was simply a matter of pounds, shillings, and pence. The skins, worth at that time 16d per pound, would of course be better value to the station at 11s per 100 paid to the trapper than they would be at £1 per 100, the price paid to the poisoner. Breach of faith and want of principle, howerer, is as nothing apparently, when weighed in the balance, against the saving of 9s on 100 skins. This little aff -iir, however, w uld probably have beent allowed to pass over in sileuca had not settling up day shown things in a far worse form. Thouaauds of good akina from among the numbers soiit in were rejected and classed as inferior, not becau&e they were iuferior according to the,con struction generally put upon that word when used in connection with rabbitskins. but for no other reason than to curtail tho amount of each mau's cheque."" To make flsh of one and flesh of another is generally admitted to be a bad precedent, yet this is exactly what was done iv the case of the gaDg to which lam alludiug. From what I kuow of them they did their work honestly and well- equally as well, It believe as did any of the other parties ; yet on settling day, three of the gangs had their poisoß given to them free, v hile the fourth had to pay the p'per— or, in other words, to pay for their poi»on in full. The only explanation glverx for this bit of busintsss was, that had they allowed this particular ,11 men to go scot free as well .as the other 30. they would have earned too good a wage- the too good a wage amonnting to 12a 'per week a man for camping out on a bleak mountain side at an altitude ot nearly JJOOOft through tbe depths of a pitiless jvinfcer, at time? plwrt'of j>royU|on?i almost tq iptarving. point, ' through the tracks and. ridges being blocked with < snow, with little or no firing, and only a sheet of ealiopover their heads. Imagine the bitter feelings, the sense of injustice rankling' in each man's breast, on being tola the reason of this unexpected"" and P should hope hitherto unheard-of partiality. ■ A word of warning to those who may be employed in a similar capacity In the future, and I have done. In future, in all agreements .like that signed by the "" unfortunate eleven,"" look out for the word *' in ferior,"" for in the hands of the unscrupulous it can take more out of your hard-earned wage than can any other word in the English language. Stipulate for "" hawkers,"" "" oreekies,"" or what you like, and you have sound ground under your feet ; but let the word as above pass unchallenged, and three-fourtha of the. skins maybe thrown out and you have no remedy. Rabbiters as a class are, I know, frequently disparaged, and their honesty as often doubted. If they are deserving of this, which I for one do not for a moment admit, the cause, if just cause there be, is not far to seek. . If station managers resort indiscriminately to such tactics as those referred to, ' depend upon it the honest man and the faithful worker will soon vacate the field, and give place to i those who are better able to meet craft with craft, and cunning with cunning. If managers would make "" their word their bond,"" if they on their part acted honourably and honestly, I do not hesitate to. say they would find as much honesty among rab biters as among any other olass of the community. If, however, they determine to treat everyone who follows that occupation as a rogue, then it is simply a question between the two. To quote the words of an old sea ballad : "" If we go dawn, these gentry on us sup ; We dine upon them it we haul them up. Wise men applaud us when we eat the enters, ; As the devil laughs when keen men cheat the cheat ers."" Thanluug you in anticipation for your kiad favour, — I am, &c\, One of the Old Brigade. October 25. i A Kejoiuder. j Editor Witness,— Sir : I notice in your issue of the 3Ut ult. a letter signed A. G. Nicol, in which he takes exception to mine of the 10th ult re filling in prospectors' holes on runs. He begins by saying that I drew the "" long bow "" in asserting that hun* dreds of sheep are lost annually in these holes, and also states that he has Been various animals in holes; but never a sheep. I conclude from this that Mr Nieol'B experience does not extend beyond the West Coast, where the stock of sheep la practically nil. When I was on the Const all the sheep used there arrived by steamer, or were driven across the West Coast road, via Arthur's Pass, and were killed find used immediately on arrival. Mr Nicol speaks of the probablity of -ny visiting tho Dunedin Exhibition. Should he honour Otago on that occasion with his august presence I shall be happy to meet him there andconducthim through thisdistrlctfreeof expense; and if I do not, in a couple of days, convince him of the truth of my statement by ocular demonstration as to the loss of sheep iv holes, then I will present him with a season tioket for the Exhibition. With regard to the other classes of stock in which I dabble, as Mr Nicol terms it, the following is my loss for the 12 months ending September s— Out of 40 head of cattle two cows and two calves went in holes, and out of eight horses I lost in the came way an upstanding mare within one month of foaling, and a thoroughbred foal three months old— just en tered in the stud-book. Should Mr Nieol favour ma with a visit, I can show him the remains of these animals ljiDg in or near the holes in which they were lost. 1 may add that the above stock were tunning on grouud where the majority of the iioloa had been carefully filled, the ones that remained open having been missed Iv consequence of being overgrown with vegetation. Mr Nicol further states that the production of gold is of more importance t j New Zealand than the stock interests. The total value of mutton and wool produced in the country last year cannot have been far short of £5,000,000 sterling ; add to this the value of the cattle increase, with the hides, &c, exported, and also the horses bred, and the total amount will, I fancy, make Mr Nicol's pet industry take a back seat. It must not be forgotten that the pastoral industry is yearly improving the country, •while the gold industry is simply a powerful engine of wholesale destruction, producing large sums of money no doubt, but at the same time discounting those amounts by ruining large areas of valuable land for all time, besides turning our finest rivers into mere sludge channels. One would fancy from the tone in which Mr Nicol writes that he twould like to see the whole country surrendered to the miners and the rabbits. I fancy he would soon tire of a continual course of rabbit pie, and be inclined to hail with delight the advent of the much despised mutton. There is no industry in the colony that has been bo much pampered by Government as gold mining, Public money nas been lavishly spent on water races and sludge channels, and large areas of the public estate reserved as commonages for miners' cattle, or for miners' to run their tailings on ; still the miners, like Oliver, are always '• asking for more."" In con clusion, I should like to inform Mr Nicol that al though I have taken the pastora'istß' Bide in this correspondence, I have a considerable Bum invested in mining, and that so far from wishing to prevent prospecting I have even permitted it on private pro perty, but at the same time I do not wish to see other interests tuffer needlessly. The filling cf prospectors' holes, while doing no harm that I can see to the interests of mining in general, would assist materially in reducing the friction at present exist ing between the two classes of the community. Mr Nicol can obtain my name and address from the Witness office, or I shall be happy to forward him my card by post,— Youvs, &c. Stockownhu. Berwick, November 4.",LetterToEditor

The Miracle.,"'Tis Thursday, the 14th day of July, 18—, the time nearly midnight ; the place a low, saudy beach on the banks of the roaring Western canon — at a point where the dread ful canon, previously described, ends. At this time and spot four very distinguished personages stand — two ladies and two gentle men — namely, Stanley Woodthorp, our friend Geoffrey, his mother, and her beauti ful daughter Edith. The latter, as she looks at the raiOions of tons of broken, white w.rer rushing by, wears a confident smile. Not so her mother, whe, dividing h^r mock ins? glances bet-waun tbe mighty torrent and Mr Stanley Woo3thorp, finds an opportunity to whisper to her somewhat bewiJdered son maliciously. « Behold tbe Miracle Worker 1 "" Stanlpy Woodihorp wa3 the oaly one of the party who, although outwardly calm, was inwardly quaking over the issues of this trial. Terrible to him would it be if failure ensued ; for the brother Geoffrey bad found opportunity to relate all that had passed be tween him and bis mother. Yet he put on a bold face in reply to the mocking tones of tne lady when she called to him : ""Now, sir king-, wben does the miracle basin ? "" "" Now 1 "" he auswared, stridiag towards a thick bunch of convclvoli hanging down from a buttress of J-be Cihoa side. Bnrying hi? head among the leaves, he said in a loud voice, which seemed to echo away up the dizzy height immediately above him : "" Let ths ten million tons of boiling water through this caiion cease their flow ! "" Then he remained in s'leoce, th« Lady Edith— and even laughing Geoffrey— becom ing awe-stricken as r,he moments passed on. Presently the earth rocked under their feet; there was a muffled sound overhead and then an awful roar filled the mountains all around. Tbe mocking tones of the lady instantly changed to those of concern, aud she called in anxious voice, although quite unblent wifeh anything so plebeian as fear: "" Mr Stanley Woodhhorp I "" He v/as by her side in a inafcaut ; but she noted not his presence, so fixed was her gaze on yonder gnarlod ironwcod, which seemed tottering upon tho brink of that height above the zig-zag which they bad some hours previous descended. Dall had fallen the shades of evening, and pale through the rolling clouds had glimmered the rising stars, and now, at this first watch, of the night, had risen tbe round, full, autumn moon to that height which showed the distorted li-nbs of tbe giant rata, whose trunk, va°S in girth, covered with knots, reddening moss, and cinker stains, spoke of that remote antiquity con temporaneous with Janvid and the dreaded Maaagarm iv their native elements — San guelac. Tbe tree assumed all manner of ccooked, deformed, and fantastic shapes, and showed uncanny silhouettes agaiast that midnight silvery liefbfc. and etill the pcrty gazed on us ona transfixed. At length a low sound, like that of the wind blowing over a bottla mouth, came from an anfclered limb of the ironwcod, then the fearlul note swelled like the wail of a?i old pine tree in a freshening wind, and v?hen it died away something slowly moved and rose. Tbe lady clutched the extended arm of Stanley; and as all four — be and she, Edith and Geoffrey — watched, the silhouette took the outline of a human shape, giant in height, but boney end irregular in form as the gnarled ironwood or antiquated skeleton. Rearing to its full height the thiag stretched one lean arm towards the group, and extend ing tbe other to the waters boiling from the cdfion, broke forth iato tfce following rugged chant :— Behold the might of yon turbulent river, With its millions of tons to the dim for ever— When Janvid lived, dame of this ironwood tree ; When the last of the Saxons of England was free Ere yon fast-speeding torrent had burst its rock girth, I was lord of the valley, the forest, the earth ! An' heard ye the loud trumpet's blast ? An' heard ye the Hammer of Thor ? See ! see ! it hath conquered at last ! And the waters are leaving their shore ! ! ! Just then, as an inky black cloud obscured tho inooa, all four turned in the direction of the river, and beheld with amaze that its roar had ceased aud its waters had fled 1 Looking back at the iroawood, tree tbe lady whispered agitatedly : "" It's gone ! "" The ghoal had vanished, and a huge owl fluttered on heavy wing about the aged tree, and from out the frondd below its roots came the hoarse croak of a morepork. Bracing her nerves, but keeping a tight hold of Stanley's arm, the lady breathed fervently into his ear, "" Son-in-law, lead me over that river bed even a& Jjj-hua of old led ovar dry shod the children of Israel. No longar dare I oppose the union of a man who twice saved my dear Geoffrey from misery and death and at whose command even a mighty river ceases to flow with Edith, the daughter of my youth."" And so rhey four— three of them being in tbe secret — walked about the dry, rocky bed of that river, p>cking out of the crannies thereof, in the straggling light of the moon, nuggets of. gold. And the water came not down again till after they had all regained the track by the ironwood tree at the head of the zig-zag, when Mr Stanley Woodthorp briefly introduced the ghoul (who was no other lhan our old friend Charley Stuart) to his intended mother-in-law, at the same time complimenting him on his adroitness.",Fiction

But if a Bakewell should appear among us, we will make him welcome, and treat him well; and if the worst comes to the worst and we don’t do him justice, he can shelter his sheep in home-built sheds. There is a very clever young fellow in the village, James Miles, the son of the wheelwright. If Bakewell cannot build a sheepshed, for almost no thing Miles will show him how.” “Do you not think, sir, that the law as to the removal of buildings by the tenant is wrong?” “ I think all laws are wrong that favor the landlord ; but as John Bull is slow at Reform we shall probably wait twenty or thirty years for this repeal. Anything more about unexhausted improvements, Mr. Lambert ? ” “ Yes, sir; the land is in a foul state, and if it be left clean at the end of our respective terms, the cost of the improve ment should be allowed.” “I have walked over every field, and I find that yours is the foulest farm, Mr. Frost. It is as bad as it can be. You intend to have a lease, I hear. At the end of it how much would you expect, be sides the customary [tillages, for leaving the land clean.” Ss Upon my word, sir,” said Mr. Frost, “ I don’t know as I could tell you what I should expect, but I should like to get all I could.” “ Quite right, Mr. Frost, Would L2 an acre for every acre left clean satisfy you ? ” “ Tithing Farm is 300 acres,” said the future tenant. Do you mean L6OO free for nothing besides tillages ? ” “ That is what I mean. Gentlemen, we landlords have got the whip hand over our tenants in these brisk times, and we can make our own terms; but suppose the times were bad, and I, Mr. Frost, were more at your mercy than I am now, you would not ask for compensation for couch at the expiration of your lease, but at the commencement. Our friend, Mr. Lam bert, with his theories has put us on the wrong scent.” "" So he has, sir,” said Mr. Frost with a jovial grin on his broad face. “We ought to settle for the couch now, sir, and not twenty-one years hence. ‘ A bird in the hand’s worth two in the bush. ’ ” “I am entirely against the principle of piling up a bill for the incoming tenant to pay,” said Mr. Goodhope, “ and I wil act the same as if we were on level terms. I will help you make your bargains, gentle men. That is the honest policy, and may be the best in the long run. If bad times overtake us, they shall find this estate well equipped, the rents ten screws at least below the topmost, and the tenants (let ua hope) well balanced at the bankers.” “Your theory of estate management, Sir, could not possibly be sounder,” said Mr. Lambert, “so far as I understand si” u How about the couch, sir ? ” said Mr, Frost, “you spoke of ready payment 1 ” “ Yes, L2 twenty-one years hence, would not be half so good at 5 per cent, compound Interest, as LI now.” “Nothing like so good, sir,” said Mr. Frost, with his broadest smile. “ I will pay LI an acre for the couch now, and we will have a memorandum that such a payment has been made, the fatm being foul, and that the money should be returned with compound inter est, at the expiration of the lease, unless the .land be left in a clean, husbandlike condition, the point to be arranged by ar bitration, the arbitrators being you and mo, or our representatives, and an umpire to be appointed who knows the land. It will never do to leave these settlements to the lawyers, gentlemen. , “lam much obliged to you, sir,” said Mr. Frost. “Can’t you think of some more unexhausted improvements, Mr. Lambert, to be paid for beforehand ? ” “In regard to ‘ condition 1 ’ Mr. Good hope. The land is in poor ‘condition.’ Suppose it be left full of manure ? ” “In the case of an expiring lease, that is not likely,” said Mr. Goodhope, “ nor, bn the other hand, are practical and shrewd men likely to try the experiment of running the land out and burning their fingers 'in the operation. Gentlemen of the cabinet council, we must legislate for average cases, we cannot legislate for ex ceptions. Can you propose a better scheme than this ?—the land being out of heart, the crop of straw you will presently take will be small, and by the custom o; the country it should be valued to you al|\ fodder price. Suppose you take it at a market price, paying the difference into my pocket. The operation will not enrich me much, and at quitting you will reap the benefit, if your crops have become bulky through Mgh farming.” “ I think I may say we are all perfectly satisfied,” said Mr. Lambert. “ I see, sir, that you are proceeding on principle. ” “ And its a principle,” said Mr. Frost, “which I like uncommonly, and I’m darned if your plans ain’t right, too, be tween man and man,” and Mr. Frost slapped his band fiat down upon his big leg. “If all the world was honest, sir,” he said, looking straight into the squire’s face, “ and if each helped t’other, instead of trying to get the better of him, we should prosper more all round, and make our fortunes quicker.” The “council” then arranged payments for the unexhausted value of feeding stuffs and manures in the last years of the ten ancy. Such arrangements were novel then, they are not so much so now as to require discussion and description here. “Andjnow,” said Mr. Goodhope, “I have some unexhausted improvements to claim. I will tell you what will happen. A railway will come up this valley, to .connect the coast and London, within five years, and there will be a station at Comp ton. You will then send your produce to and perhaps turn your land into market gardens worth LlO an acre.” “ If you have no objection, sir,” said Mr. Frost, “ we will pay for the railroad ;at the end of the lease instead of the beginning.” “I suppose,” said the squire, “I must consider the railway, when it comes, as a gift of the country to my tenants, ” Those six applicants hired between them 2000 acres, and the rest of the estate (about 3000 acres more) was let in farms of from 150 to 300 acres, besides a dozen plots of from 20 to 50 acres, which were held provisionally by the nearest occupier in reserve for deserving men. The abom inable nest of gardenless cottages in the village, called the Oxyard, was pulled down, and the new cottages were distri buted over the farms, a little nearer to the work and farther from the Bull. Mrs. Thomback lost her trade, and William Root brewed an excellent mixture of malt and hops at home. Mr. Qoodhope worked at the improve ments with heart and soul. Many a walk ha and his council took over the land together, and most admirable and economical were the results of their collective judgment. Playing at estate management, or shirking it as agents may. sometimes do, are quite different things from the “statesman-like” method. The energy of Squire Goodhope created energy in all concerned and ensured suc cess. Changes affecting individuals ivere avoided as far as possible. Fortunately several fa? ms were already on the market when the estqte was sold. Three or four werelhsld by neighboring farmers and speculators at a low price who were glad to be riu of them, having had their fingers badly bitten by the rabbits. Some were on hand, others were held by old fellows who retired in favor of ener getic sons, so that the number of “evicted” tenants, to use the harshest term, was small. Numerous other changes there were, no doubt, but Mr. Goodhope was a consummate tactician, and his changes were not only advantage ous, but they were made to seem iuevit abable ! Who could regret the Oxyard 1 Who could complain of the big gardens (from a quarter to half an acre) tacked on to the new cottages, and taken off the farms before they were let ? But of Mr. Gooclliope’s plans for im proving the condition of the laborers (or rather, for enabling them to improve it for themselves) —piece-work payments, allotment grounds, village ready-money shops, cow plots, and the rest of them— we must let him speak elsewhere.

CHAPTER XXXI. But though Kildee was at the mayor's] house next morning at eight o'clock, he had already left the city on the early-western train. He had gone to attend a political meeting at Milan, a town twenty miles from Wallport. The meeting was most im portant. A great crowd was expected, for the two opposing candidates for the highest state office were, for the first time, to be pitted against each other. Many of the Wallport people were on the train, going out to be present at the contest. Repre sentatives of the city press and correspon dents of other papers were there with wide open eyes and ears and busy pencils. Among these was Hazard Hall. ' The young journalist was in buoyant spirits. There was to be an afternoon issue of ""The Rattler,"" to which he would telegraph the proceed ings of the meeting. The edition would be large, for it would contain (Hazard trusted) a fatal bomb for Heathcliff—the announce ment that General Montcalm had consented to be run as independent candidate for governor. Hazard had already prepared this announcement with flaring capitals and headlines, so confident was he of the result of Honor's declaration to her father that she would not marry Heathcliff. He had shown what he had written to the chief of "" The Ratt]er,"" who had engaged to call upon the general and urge him to verify the announcement of his candidacy at once, as no time was to be lost. The indepen dent side had only two months in which to work. Hazard was still in suspense. His scheme to search the Red House to-day had to be postponed for twenty-four hours because of this important meeting at Milan. Also he could not be sure what General Montcalm would do. However, he was sanguine in both respects. He meant to be back at ""Wallport in a few hours. By two o'clock the speaking would be over. He would take the train that passed through Milan at that hour and reach the city in time to see General Montcalm himself before "" The Battler "" wont to press. He knew his in fluence over the general. Young though he was, his shrewd insight, his impetuoifs will, his dash and daring, had captivated the old warrior-statesman. He could hardly hold out against the arguments and persua eion of his favourite. The assemblage at Milan amounted almost to a mass meeting. There were speeches; first light skirmish popping, then heavy guns. Norton's well-preserved, portly presence filled the speakers' stand for nearly an hour. He made a graceful, oily address, starred ■with brilliant points and plausible argu ment. He was a wily politician and a practised speaker, but the people knew him of old. A feeling that he was not to be trusted blunted the point pf his eloquence and his sarcasm. When Heathcliff rose there was a murmur of applause. His political record was short, and not especially brilliant. He had served bis state in her legislative assembly during several terms, and filled the post faithfully and ably. It was known that it had not benefited him pecuniarily. Money he could not want; his. income from his mills and the rent from his houses amounted to many thousands. He had a reputation for solid Integrity, for justice and liberality. He fcad not given lavishly, but wisely, to pub- Uc enterprises pf industry and of charity. He was a man—so looked upon—to be re iied on as a safe if not brilliant head of etate affairs. His preseuce alone helped to inspire this feeling. The tall, massive figure, the fine head on columnar throat, the calm, search ing eye, the deep, tranquil tones—these seemed tokens of a man strong enough to bear the burdens of state. ""His speech seemed the fit expression of such a man. Simple in its form, bare of ornate rhetoric, almost devoid of personality, but clear, comprehensive, informed with the power of earnest conviction, it was hailed as a master piece of large insight and manly feeling. When the applause died away and Hazard Hall's boyish face and willowy but well knit figure was seen on the speakers' stand, and it was found he was about to speak in opposition to Heathcliff, he was at first hardly listened to ; but he forced attention by the grace of his presence and the daring of his utterances. He was opposed to both candidates. He roundly asserted that neither was ./he man .for the position ; that neither should or would win in the race.. ""Wait for the dark horse,"" he cried; ""the pure thorough-bred; the war-horse with his neck clothed with the thunder of many victories on actual fields of combat and on the battle-grounds of state; wait, and you shall see hPw easily he will distance this plebeian stock."" ~-. He flashed his scathing satire along the pact political record of.Norton, and then he turned its edge upon Heathcliff. He knew that sarcasm and insinuation were the'oiily weapons he could use against the Mayor of Wallport. He rang the changes on the gasping ambition of the rich man, who, not content with having coined his thousands out of the sweat pf the labouring poor, now wanted to mount to political eminence upon their votes. He ridiculed what he called the Sunday-school record of Heathcliff. He pictured him as a second patron, a condescending patriarchal Pharisee, dis pensing tracts arid blessirigs instead of bread to poor tenants and employe's, whose rents he was careful not to lower and whose wages he piously refrained from raising lest their pride should be puffed up. .■ Satire, however false, always tells, at least for the instant. Hazard's speech was as brilliant and spicy as it was unjust, ""ft created laughter and applause. Presently, however, the applause changed to hisses,, The listeners detected personal venom unefsr. the rattling ridicule. Hazard turned to leave the stand with a flushed brow, but he faced the crowd again and cried put with fierce energy: "" Time will verify what I have said. In a little while the people pf this State will see the moral veil torn from their Mokanno idol. I make no groundless prophecy. I cay what I know."" There was some applause ; then &.gjborm of hisses, and cries of '' Heathcliff! Heath - cliff!"" The man so audaciously attacked had sat with unmoved face during the bitter speech. Outwardly immobile as granite, yet the ewift, hurling sarcasms had ptung him deeply. Resentment was the first feeling to spring up under them. They came from ene he had secretly aided with money and influence. They came from the son of a woman who had wronged him cruelly. It was in his power by a few words to humiliate this daring youngster, and his first impulse was to do itv The impulse passed before Hazard's speech was over. When at length he came forward in response to repeated calls, the little speech he made was calm and controjle'd. His allusi'oß to his youthful detractor, though it carried a sting of quiet irony, was tolerant and dignified. It was as though"" a buffalo brushed a gad-fly from his withers. -Satire, rattier thai* jjrutb, he eaid, was the weapon of youth' and inex perience. It was showy, but superficial. The young man would learn to use it mow dlectfipiriatelv wlie'n he'was older,. .; "" Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers.? Then while Hazard inwardly Writhed tinder his quiet tolerance, which SeemST'to mean contempt, Jie ""gassed on to other points. The attack had warmed him into jnagnetism. This"" little spontaneous fpleeph was full of contagious feeling, and the applimpe was enthusiastic. The meeting closed with a barbecue, ya the midst of $hijah came the noon express train,"" and a number pf Wallport people, among them Hazard Hall, returned to the city. Norton also went.' He wanted to get there in time to prepare for a reception that was to be given him that evening. Heathcliff remained until later. He re turned at six o'clock on the passenger train. A crowd accompanied him to the cars. Their huzzas came to his ears as the train bore him away. I It was an hour of triumph, and Heath cliffs pulses beat more quickly than was their wont. He was thinking how Honor would glory in his success of to day. Ambition had always been a master impulse of his nature: but he had hitherto held it in check. Now he felt that there was danger of its becoming a feverish thirst. The deep passion hefelt""for Honor Mont calm had reacted on his whole being. For her sake he coveted honours ; for her sake he deterniined to win the present political goal, no matter what obstacle bavred liis way. There seemed no obstacle now worth dreading. His way seemed clear to elec tion, and then the people's confidence should not be disappointed; ""he would do jgfood work for his State. .Grand schemes'rose dimly before bis mind. His spirit was dwelling ork the heights. Did he not re member that such exalted moments often presage a fall ? The train stopped at the depot in Wall port. Heatlicliff was helping a bewildered old woman, with many baskets and bundles, off the train, when a newsboy sang out behind him: "" Evening extra of * The Kajbtler. Gen eral Mpntcalm out as independent candi date for governor."" He turned sharply round, bought a paper arid unfolded it before the gas-jet, and found the double head* of the column which an nounced that General Alexander Montcalm had at last yielded to the demands of his friends, and consented to come forward as a candidate for election on the independent platform. What could this mean ? Heathcliff would not believe that the announcement was genuine. It was the work of ""The Rattler,"" h,e thought—a plot to injure his cause. General Montcalm would not do such a thing; he would not oppose the man his daughter was about tp marry. The newspaper's assertion had an ugly look of positiyeness; still he believed it was an electioneering trick on the part of ""The Rattler."" This bplief was put to flight by the first words uttered by a friend whom he rapi upon as he left the dppot. This man had spoken with the general only an hour be fore. "" Montcalp don't seem inclined to talk about the matter,"" h© said, "" but he ad mitted that he authorised the announce ment, and says that bis decision was made not two hours before 'The Rattler' went to pre,ss. It's bad for our side. W<j shall have to work twice as hard. Th« will draw off many a vote from pur cause. The general has confidence of our party, and there'll be plenty to follow the lead. The split will be all benejat for Nor ton since it divides the votes opposed to him. He's in town to day; mads a eylla b«by speech that hty poaso cheered like forty.
